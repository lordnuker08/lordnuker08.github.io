    <h2>Why this site?</h2>
    <p>
        There are a lot of sites which give you stats about your game play and I use those sites. What I couldn't find is a site for details of activities with a lot of depth. I
        have tried to make this site more detailed than the others. Yes, there is a lot of data to fetch but it is the only way to see it.
