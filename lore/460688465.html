<h2>Unfinal Shapes</h2>
<p>
Asher,<br/><br/>I took a slough of Hive chitin, and with my own hands, I bent it into the shape of a starship. I think you of all people might understand why. But it's more than just a reminder of the green flames behind my brow.<br/><br/>Asher, I saw a throne world built for the Light. Built with Darkness, of course, and the bitter logic of swords. But built for Light.<br/><br/>It made me wonder.<br/><br/>This will be my last letter for a long while. The Queen needs me more than the City does. And I need her. When she looks at me, she does not see an invalid, or a madwoman, or a burden.<br/><br/>She sees a Hunter.<br/><br/>She has pointed me at the true enemy, and with her help, I will see my quarry caught.<br/><br/>Clarity in action,<br/>Eris Morn</p>
