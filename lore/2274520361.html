<h1>Helm of the Great Hunt</h1>
<div/>
<p>
[The Queen] would like to improve her means of [bargaining] with me. She has implied that I use the space between words to make [bargains] to my advantage.<br/><br/>How dare she.<br/><br/>She knows me so well.<br/><br/>What [the Queen] wants, the Techeun move worlds to obtain. And so the Witches devise an impossible machine that speaks a visual language with very few spaces between its words. This machine speaks [wishes]. Makes [bargains].<br/><br/>The Wall of [Wishes], it is called.<br/><br/>If the Techeun's design proves correct, it will be difficult for me to interpret the [wishes] made at the Wall to my advantage. But challenges entice me.<br/><br/>I look upon the Wall. Upon the Witches' visual language for [bargains]. For me, it is a menu of delights to feast upon.</p>
