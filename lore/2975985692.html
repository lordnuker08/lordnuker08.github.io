<h2>I.IV: Of Tattered Blood and Broken Bone</h2>
<p>
MALKANTH'S DEADLY PROMISE<br/><br/>"Then it is set.<br/>"The logic will never find purchase among the unworthy.<br/>"And be not unclear, though we revile those we seek to challenge, we are truly their kin.<br/>"If not by marrow's tie nor blooded divinity…<br/>"Then by our own failings—if not of a kind equal to their transgressions.<br/>"Yet, there is honor in the knowing…<br/>"We alone recognize our lack of worth and thus stand above those who seek Ascension ignorant of their truest reflection…<br/>"Ignorant of the logic's base demand.<br/>"But I say now, with an unfettered mind…<br/>"The sword logic is not all.<br/>"And the logic can be subverted—must be subverted.<br/>"I have studied paths both honored and depraved—the might of Oryx, the strength and cunning of his sisters, the folly of Crota's pride, and the necromantic sin of the unfavored.<br/>"I have long since stolen knowledge from the World's Grave—known texts and secret learnings.<br/>"I have prepared for this day—for the time when reliance on the rule of might—the survival of the fittest—would prove to be misguided.<br/>"Our understanding of its meaning… flawed and open to manipulations by those willing to find strength—purpose—in heresy.<br/>"I say, we are they—the sinners, the heretics…<br/>"I say… let us sin.<br/>"Let us be the liars and conspirators whose self-made truth topples stagnant, uninspired belief and births a new dynasty.<br/>"Dearest Akrazul.<br/>"Dearest Azavath.<br/>"Brother.<br/>"Sister.<br/>"Let us reap the just affliction of our suffering's reward.<br/>"We shall claim the burden of dominion and endure the pains of such tremendous weight.<br/>"Just as all others will endure, as final, unwelcome recompense, the harsh realities of their end."</p>
