<h2>Ego Talon Bond</h2>
<p><pre>I live what I teach. Every time I fire my shotgun, I reflect on our enemies. Every shell I leave in my wake is evidence of my meditations. 

I know the forces that move against us. I have studied endlessly. I have transcended our libraries.  

I listen to the whispers of my Hidden and I grow wiser every day. 

I live what I teach, but I could not predict Ghaul. This is my failing, and I must answer for it.
