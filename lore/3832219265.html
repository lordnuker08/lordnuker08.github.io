<h2>Ego Talon Bond</h2>
<p>
I live what I teach. Every time I fire my shotgun, I reflect on our enemies. Every shell I leave in my wake is evidence of my meditations. <br/><br/>I know the forces that move against us. I have studied endlessly. I have transcended our libraries.  <br/><br/>I listen to the whispers of my Hidden and I grow wiser every day. <br/><br/>I live what I teach, but I could not predict Ghaul. This is my failing, and I must answer for it.<br/><br/>â€”Ikora Rey, Warlock Vanguard</p>
