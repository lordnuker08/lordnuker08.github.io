And the second time he met her, he asked, "Would you like to dance before you go?"<br/><br/>"Not now," she had said.<br/><br/>"Wait, what did you think I said?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Would you like to dance?" she repeated.<br/><br/>"I would love to," he said, and stepped forward with his arms in the air.<br/><br/>She chuckled.<br/><br/>He paused.<br/><br/>"This has never worked before," he said.<br/><br/>He joined her in the Pilgrim Guard.
