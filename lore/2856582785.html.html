The generous Emperor, pleased to no end with his bright Shadow of Shadows, said: "Say no more. It is granted."

Giving great and proper thanks, the Shadow of Earth went away and found the Guardian whose name was once Uldren Sov. The Shadow of Earth slew him, but spared his hateful little companion-soul so that the well of pleasure that was Uldren's death should never run dry.
