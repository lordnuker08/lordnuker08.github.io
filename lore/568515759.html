Nadiya sipped her tea, calm and collected. Shinobu sat back, looking perplexed. "Really, the entire summer?"<br/><br/>The serpent that claimed to look like her mother sat across from the two of them, smiling broadly. "Why would I lie? I'm telling you, the whole summer you wore that dress. We had to tackle you to get the thing off of you, get you to bathe."<br/><br/>The serpent plucked the dainty cup from the white saucer and set it to her lips before continuing. "Your brother called you stinkbug for years. Untilâ€¦ you know."<br/><br/>Nadiya reached over and took the other Hunter's hand in her own. "It would lie because it's fulfilling your wish, Nobu."<br/><br/>Shinobu searched the serpent's face. Her mother just smiled again, all teeth and secrets. Shinobu felt tears at the corners of her eyes. Her voice was barely a whisper. "Okay. Now."<br/><br/>The burst from the pulse rifle was loud, and Nadiya pulled the trigger again and again and again.</p>
