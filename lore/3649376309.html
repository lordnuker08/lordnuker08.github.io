<h2>17: Transient</h2>
<p><pre>Geppetto-3-1-294:
Hello Sagira, Brother Osiris.
Please maintain this open communication channel.

Sagira-3-1-294:
Oh, good idea. Make us a sub-net.

Osiris-3-7-294:
I will miss my next rendezvous.

Saint-3-8-294:
Is that so? I suspected this would happen when your trip suddenly became longer. I will tell the Vanguard that your ship was damaged and has caused delay. Do not make me lie for you again. I do not like lying. It upsets Geppetto.
Additionally, tell Sagira that I remember her promise and that I am owed a debt if she does not keep it.

Osiris-4-0-294:
Sagira does not gamble.

Saint-4-1-294:
It is not gambling. It is different from gambling. She cannot be nagging you enough. Your response time on our letters is terrible.
Please try my suggestion. I believe it will help.

Osiris-5-14-294:
Is Ikora well? Are you?

Saint-5-14-294:
We are both disappointed, but we will live.
Father cannot defend you any longer. 

Osiris-5-14-294:
I will speak for myself.

Saint-5-17-294:
That was quite the show.
Where are you?

Osiris-6-2-294:
Finding answers.
We will speak soon.

Osiris-9-29-296:
Where are you?</pre></p>
