Geppetto-3-1-294:<br/>Hello Sagira, Brother Osiris.<br/>Please maintain this open communication channel.<br/><br/>Sagira-3-1-294:<br/>Oh, good idea. Make us a sub-net.<br/><br/>Osiris-3-7-294:<br/>I will miss my next rendezvous.<br/><br/>Saint-3-8-294:<br/>Is that so? I suspected this would happen when your trip suddenly became longer. I will tell the Vanguard that your ship was damaged and has caused delay. Do not make me lie for you again. I do not like lying. It upsets Geppetto.<br/>Additionally, tell Sagira that I remember her promise and that I am owed a debt if she does not keep it.<br/><br/>Osiris-4-0-294:<br/>Sagira does not gamble.<br/><br/>Saint-4-1-294:<br/>It is not gambling. It is different from gambling. She cannot be nagging you enough. Your response time on our letters is terrible.<br/>Please try my suggestion. I believe it will help.<br/><br/>Osiris-5-14-294:<br/>Is Ikora well? Are you?<br/><br/>Saint-5-14-294:<br/>We are both disappointed, but we will live.<br/>Father cannot defend you any longer. <br/><br/>Osiris-5-14-294:<br/>I will speak for myself.<br/><br/>Saint-5-17-294:<br/>That was quite the show.<br/>Where are you?<br/><br/>Osiris-6-2-294:<br/>Finding answers.<br/>We will speak soon.<br/><br/>Osiris-9-29-296:<br/>Where are you?</p>
