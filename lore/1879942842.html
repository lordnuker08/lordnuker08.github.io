<h2>Gauntlets of the Emperor's Champion</h2>
<p>
When you imagine the last moments of all life in this universe, what do you see? Is it struggle, war, and death? Are you fighting to the last breath? Are you suffering? <br/><br/>I am not. In those last moments, I am surrounded by joy, pleasure, and good company. I am the last thing that they see. They give to me the greatest giftâ€”the last of the living acknowledge that I, above all other beings, was real.</p>
