<h2>Nightstalker</h2>
<p>
The Bladedancers deride us as slow. The Gunslingers say we lack precision. “How is that better than a knife?” “How is that better than a flaming pistol?” Well.  <br/><br/>My boots sink inches into the ground with every step. My rebreather filters the stench out of the air, but my eyes sting like I'm showering with battery acid.  <br/><br/>“We're almost there,” my Ghost chirps. My jaw clenches. I know we're almost there, little Light. <br/><br/>This vile marsh opens to reveal a black cave's maw. Inside, an infinite number of little green eyes flicker like bad stars. CRACK! I fire a single bullet into the air and the horde in the cave shrieks and runs out.  <br/><br/>“This is it, you two.” The Warlock and Titan leap from the bog behind me. A bow appears in my hands and I let a single binding shot loose from the shadow.  <br/><br/>Now there are Orbs of Light everywhere. Eat, my friends. Eat.</p>
