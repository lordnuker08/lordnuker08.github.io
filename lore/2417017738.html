<h2>Ódrerir</h2>
<p><pre>We post these words 
for all to see,
though words 
are soon forgot.
The works of our 
Black Armory
live on, though 
bodies rot.

Lest working hands 
grow idle now,
with gaze 
fixed 'pon the sky,
we plant our feet 
on solid ground,
and earthward 
turn our eye.

Though boundless space 
does treasure hold,
and gifts 
seem cheap or free,
we wait and watch 
this age of gold,
sad vigil 
though it be.

We place our works 
in hands of all
and guard 
'gainst threats unknown.
For though we gaze
into the stars,
we first must
shield our own.</pre></p>
