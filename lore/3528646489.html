<h2>Saint's Vocation</h2>
<p>
Saint,<br/><br/>I regret that we must once again part ways so soon after your return. Knowing you are there to watch over the Trials assuages my concerns and is the only reason I feel comfortable departing on this urgent mission. I must leave you with a monition, though. Be forewarned, the former custodian of the Lighthouse was delving into dangerous territory. The Lighthouses are not what they seem. They may bring a ruin upon us that we have no answer for. They may also be innocuous, but you know their architects as well as I. Lean toward caution. I urge a careful eye and ear. Their final intent is not known to me. <br/><br/>I will return. I look forward to our reunion. Stay vigilant.<br/><br/>Yours, in time,<br/>Osiris</p>
