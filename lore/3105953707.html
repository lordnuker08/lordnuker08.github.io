<h2>Chill of Winter</h2>
<p>
"They're Travelers. Little snowy Travelers."<br/><br/>Jazla looked down at the snowman again. The lower body, with ice pieces held in orbit by twigs. Just like what was in the sky behind her partner.<br/><br/>"It's a coincidence." But she knew it wasn't. The torso, deliberately shaded with what, coal? Blackened on the bottom, just like what was in the sky until a few months ago.<br/><br/>"We both know it's not. Not after what he drew last week. And now this. One dead Traveler. One alive Traveler. Another Traveler for a head."<br/><br/>"What's the other one?" Jazla gestured at the well-formed sphere a few feet away. Hollowed out. Overgrown with vegetation that their son had obviously placed there. Neatly. Deliberately.<br/><br/>"That one… is why I think we need to talk to Lakshmi about him."<br/><br/>Jazla didn't look up. She had fought against it for so long, but… maybe it was time. The Dawning, right? New beginnings.<br/><br/>A tear disappeared into the frozen ground.</p>
