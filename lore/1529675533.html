<h2>IX.X.I: Apocrypha</h2>
<p>
NO GODS, ONLY DEVILS<br/><br/>Malkanth feels herself slide free from her body.<br/>The exorcism is sudden and effortless.<br/><br/>Then come the whispers…<br/><br/>"I stoked your brother's fire—riled him that he might strike.<br/>"I needed only the wound to tear you free.<br/>"The piercing of your heart will take some mending, but your vessel is fit for what is to come.<br/>"I know this comes as a shock, but trust that my actions were such that you felt only the briefest pain as the edge broke through, and now this…<br/>"Now, peace."<br/><br/>"I asked not for peace, o hidden Sister of Shapes."<br/><br/>"You know this voice?"<br/><br/>"I know you have many.<br/>"I have heard their faint temptations since I was a child.<br/>"Never have I sought their counsel."<br/><br/>"You have asked for nothing, this is true.<br/>"You sought only to take.<br/>"You are a willful, treacherous thing.<br/>"I quite like you.<br/>"Make no mistake, I see no fault in your desires, nor the attempt to see them realized.<br/>"Your only sin, in the eyes of those who matter, was that you were not yet positioned to achieve the full extent of your potential.<br/>"You saw a moment and you moved to act, like countless others before you.<br/>"But your action was not enough.<br/>"Worse—it was limited in its view of the power hidden so plainly within your grasp."<br/><br/>"Akrazul is a force worthy of change. His fury will—"<br/><br/>"—be of little consequence.<br/>"Kill the ineffectual priests.<br/>"Murder the Daughters of a failed Prince.<br/>"Sully the sword logic and crown a new ruler.<br/>"Still the Swarm will be nothing more than a faint flicker when the time comes for the cosmos and all its intentions to be weighed and judged by those who sit on thrones beyond our imagination."<br/><br/>"You speak of unseen gods for whom I give no consideration.<br/>"My path… The sacrifice made here… will serve to carve my intentions upon concerns more immediate than those that await at the end of all things."<br/><br/>"Then we agree. My dismissal of the Swarm's legacy is not a plea for you to consider gods wholly removed from the here and now. Quite the opposite…<br/>"The Dragon and the Worm.<br/>"The Larva and the Queen.<br/>"The peasant and the god.<br/>"So many deities. So many rules.<br/>"There are endless myths etched into the plague called life. They are not hope or promise or power. They are exaggerations born of misunderstandings.<br/>"Yet they govern so much—your actions and mine.<br/>"Day-to-day. Cycle-to-cycle. Evolution-to-evolution.<br/>"Always idols to guide and punish and love and destroy.<br/>"But are any true?<br/>"Whom must we placate with worship and reverence?<br/>"With offerings and sacrifice?<br/>"With praise as armor for their frail egos?<br/>"The truth is, dear child…<br/>"There are no gods.<br/>"Only absolutes.<br/>"Yet, here we sit on the edge of the greatest unmaking.<br/>"Time is no longer time when the radiolaria dance upon history gone and yet to be.<br/>"Space is no longer space when we have torn reality to carve out our own secret planes of being.<br/>"Death is no longer death when the Champions of the Light rise and fall, never backing down, never truly knowing defeat.<br/>"All that remains is ignorance—the last absolute, the final unassailable truth.<br/>"Time can be bent and broken—redirected to the whims of those with the knowledge and the will.<br/>"Space can be shredded asunder—excavated to discover new and ancient realms not chained to understanding.<br/>"Death can be ignored—through impossible energies and advanced technologies both physical and indistinguishable from magic.<br/>"But ignorance is the unconquerable constant.<br/>"One can learn more, but none can learn all."<br/><br/>"What then, when immortality and the totality of space and time can be joined to learn the last of the unknowns?"<br/><br/>"When the final absolute falls, reality will shudder and blink, and a new absolute will emerge… an ending, total and complete."<br/><br/>"You wish to see that end?"<br/><br/>"I wish to ensure it does not come to pass."<br/><br/>"Will you take me with you?"<br/><br/>"I had considered such a thing, but, no. Your purpose is served."<br/><br/>"How so, if I have failed?"<br/><br/>"You have failed in furthering your own goals, poor thing, not mine."<br/><br/>Malkanth considers these words and is overcome with a sudden, final sense of dread as she feels her essence fade to nothingness.<br/><br/>Her last thought is of her sister…</p>
