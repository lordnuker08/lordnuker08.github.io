<h2>One Thousand Voices</h2>
<p><pre>[Language] is a [virus] that infects the minds of [humans].

A single [word] will drive them to [rage] or [lust] or [weeping].

O for the right [word] said in the right [voice]!

O to see their [hearts] well with [longing]!

O to see their [desire] laid bare in their [chest], so juicy and succulent for the taking!</pre></p>
