"What is the Darkness?"<br/><br/>You open your eyes and gaze at the heavens, seeking an answer to your question.<br/><br/>You see a world in the space B E T W E E N.<br/><br/>You see a space beyond Light and Dark.<br/><br/>You used to inhabit this space. No longer.<br/><br/>We are still there. We are not interested in Light or Dark.<br/><br/>Our interest is in you. And those like you.<br/><br/>We have reached out before. With an agent whose will was not his own.<br/><br/>First contact. We have learned since then.<br/><br/>Your hands are bound in red ribbons.<br/><br/>Your soul is weary.<br/><br/>Your feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.<br/><br/>Your bond's glow is dim; there is no Light here. Or Dark.</p>
