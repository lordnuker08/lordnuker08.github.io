Consensus Meeting 2891.98<br/><br/>NM: "I note for the record that we are without a Warlock Vanguard or a Vanguard Commander."<br/>Andal Brask: "Two birds, one man."<br/>Zavala: "Ikora Rey is interim Warlock Vanguard for this meeting."<br/>Speaker: "Which brings us to our first order of business. Ikora Rey, the Consensus formally requests you assume the responsibilities of Warlock Vanguard."<br/>Ikora Rey: "Considering I've been performing those responsibilities for a while now, I accept."<br/>FWC: "Why did you cover for him for so long?"<br/>IR: "Someone had to do it."<br/>S: "Ahem. Now that we have Consensus, I may inform you I have decided to banish former Warlock Vanguard Osiris from the Last City."<br/>[murmurs]<br/>S: "Are there any objections?"<br/>DO: "None here. Maybe he'll find a better planet for us."<br/>[pause]<br/>S: "Very well. Next: I name Titan Vanguard Zavala as the new Vanguard Commander. Congratulations."</p>
