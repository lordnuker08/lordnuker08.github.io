<h2>The Long Walk</h2>
<p>
[Eight sparks. A ninth, dim in the corner. And Orin in the middle.] <br/>ORIN: Are we all here? Come into the light, please. <br/>G-9: I like where I am. <br/>ORIN: They said you all went to the deep without a ship. How? <br/>G-7: Our charges are gone, but we're still creatures of Light. No different from the one you carry in your pocket. <br/>ORIN: You're all either very brave or very foolish. <br/>G-6: You sound like Shaxx. <br/>G-5: She does. I'm glad my charge is gone. <br/>G-4: Don't say that. <br/>G-5: It's true. <br/>G-4: Don't say it out loud. Some of us go our whole lives without finding one. Show some respect. <br/>G-5: Don't talk like you're better than me. You're in here, too. <br/>ORIN: Please. I'm sorry to call you all here, butâ€” <br/>G-2: You're not sorry. <br/>ORIN: I need to know what you found out there. <br/>G-9: Nothing. <br/>ORIN: At least give me the coordinates.</p>
