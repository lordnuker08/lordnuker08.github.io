"It's Saint-14's idea more than mine," the Speaker said.<br/><br/>Tallulah leaned against the wall, her arms tightly crossed. "That guy has a lot of ideas, seems like."<br/><br/>"Would you consider it?"<br/><br/>She tilted her head to look at the sky, as if imploring the Traveler for patience. "Listen," she said, and dropped her chin again. "Organizing all the Hunters in the system doesn't make sense. The whole idea of being a Hunter is about…" She struggled to find the right word.<br/><br/>"Disorganization?" the Speaker supplied dryly.<br/><br/>"Ha ha." There was no amusement in the laughter.
