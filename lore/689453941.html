<h2>The Frigid Jackal</h2>
<p>
"Move. Shoot. Move. That's the way you have to function out here. Combat moves too fast to post up somewhere; situations evolve constantly. We don't have the luxury of a defensible position with reinforcements popping in and out. That Devrim doesn't know how lucky he is in that regard. But I wouldn't want to be him. Eventually, there will be an enemy at his gate."<br/>â€”Tango-9, Vanguard Marksman</p>
