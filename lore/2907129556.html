"Please! You don't understand. I'm supposed to be on that ship." <br/><br/>The guard smiled at Sigrun with gentle condescension. "That's not possible, ma'am." <br/><br/>She understood why he would believe that; all of the colonists had entered cryo two weeks ago, but she could see the crew waving for pictures. They were awake!

She could find whatever horrible cryo-coffin they'd loaded Victor into; she could kneel before it and beg him to forgive her. He wouldn't hear her but he wasn't gone yetâ€” <br/><br/>"I need you to take a step back, ma'am." <br/><br/>"Captain Jacobson!" Sigrun darted past the guard. "I'm a colonist! You can't leave without me!"</p>
