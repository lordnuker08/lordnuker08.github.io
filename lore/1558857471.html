<h2>Cosmos Shell</h2>
<p>
The old doubts came back when the Light went out.<br/>But the iron in her bones, worn and rusted as it was, never buckled.<br/>The Light was gone, but holding a sniper rifle still felt right.<br/>She marched into the City beneath a refugee's hood, took up a roost in the building with the white rabbit, and killed 216 Cabal with 199 bullets.<br/>She cried when the Traveler woke before her eyes.<br/>At her hip a radio blinked to life. It had gone quiet when the Red Legion attacked. She answered it with trembling fingers.<br/>"I know," she said. "I can see it. I can feel it."<br/>"Even the stars are brighter now," said the voice over the radio. "The whole cosmos is ablaze."<br/>She closed her eyes. "I can't wait to see it. I'm coming home. Efrideet out."</p>
