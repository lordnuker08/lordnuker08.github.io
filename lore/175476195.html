"The fluid itself is not the Vex. If their consciousness could be contained in such a state, it would have manifested in other states by now."<br/><br/>Ikora looks up from the terminal.<br/><br/>"Perhaps Lakshmi's device is the key. Was I wrong to dismiss it?" She chuckles. She does that a lot more, lately. "Probably. I was wrong about a lot of things."<br/><br/>She paces, hands behind her back.<br/><br/>"If understanding their ability to manipulate simulations and, in doing so, appear to travel to different times is our goal, then…" She stops and turns to look… at me?<br/><br/>"What do you think, Ophiuchus?"<br/><br/>She hasn't spoken to me in 22,303 days. I haven't spoken to her in almost as long. I'm speechless.<br/><br/>"You're not just my Ghost. We were friends, once. I want to know what you think."<br/><br/>I try to maintain my composure. I don't think it works. "I'm glad you asked."</p>
