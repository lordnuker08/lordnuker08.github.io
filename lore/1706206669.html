<h2>Gallant Charge</h2>
<p>
"How did they find me? Every direction I turn, there they are. The beady phosphorescent red eyes of the Hobgoblins fill in the darkness around me. I look for cover, but more infernal machines teleport in, blocking my path. <br/><br/>"I'm outnumbered. Perhaps my luck has run out. <br/><br/>"They inch closer in pairs. Two by two they prepare to disintegrate me. <br/><br/>"There is still more for me to do. More heads to break.<br/> <br/>"My weapon charges. I breathe in. <br/><br/>"I move."<br/><br/>—Saint-14</p>
