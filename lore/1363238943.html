"That's not right."<br/><br/>Banshee-44 taps a spectral analyzer against the Effigy's frame.<br/><br/>Commander Zavala turns, closes the lid on a small golden weapon case, and walks to Banshee's side. "What have you found?"<br/><br/>"Well, it's not petrified wood, but it is organic."<br/><br/>"That's troubling," Zavala says and moves to run his fingers over the weapon's frame.<br/><br/>"I wouldn't."<br/><br/>A shallow cold saps the heat from Zavala's fingertips; he pulls back. "This wasn't in Eris's report." His voice is thin and stark with disappointment, as if spoken through dead winter air.<br/><br/>"Guardian doesn't seem to notice either." Banshee clinks the analyzer into a tool tray. "Leeches a bit, kicks out Void. Sig's hazy, though. Wild."<br/><br/>Long quiet overtakes the workshop, imposed by shuttered windows and empty streets below.<br/><br/>They stand over the weapon. Banshee stares down and nods along to the ambient static.<br/><br/>"What were you saying?" The weapon master's voice is framed in apology.<br/><br/>Zavala puts a hand on Banshee's shoulder, smiles, and gestures to the weapon. "Equipment that uses the wielder's Light is not unprecedented."<br/><br/>"It doesn't use it; it eats it. Thing's got an appetite. Works almost like, uhâ€¦ a converter."<br/><br/>"Is it dangerous?"<br/><br/>"Nah. Guardian doesn't even seem to notice. I'll get you a write-up."</p>
