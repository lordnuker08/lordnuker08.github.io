Yardarm-4 looked grim. It was the face he always made when he switched from his sometimes abrasive affability to the somber disdain that meant he was taking a situation seriously. There was also that hot glimmer in his eyes that presaged that he was going to say something to provoke her.<br/><br/>"You underestimated them."<br/><br/>There was no venom in the words, just a simple fact plainly stated.<br/><br/>Rekkana put a hand on Lisbon-13's arm before he leapt to her defense.<br/><br/>"Yes," she said.<br/><br/>There was no point in dissembling and no shame in being wrong.

Perhaps it's their greatest weakness."<br/><br/>"Yes. So we must—" Rekkana stopped. Lisbon-13 raised the weapon they'd claimed, his head on the swivel.<br/><br/>Yardarm-4 followed suit. "What is that?" Yardarm-4 sounded rattled. "Where's it coming from?"<br/><br/>The three of them stood back to back-to-back, listening.<br/><br/>"I don't hear—" But then she did.</p>
