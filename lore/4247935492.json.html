<h2>Equitis Shade Cowl</h2>
<p><pre>You've shown the Red Legion you fly my banner.

I know that when the time is right, I won't have to ask. You're on my side.

I see it when you relieve our foes of their skulls. When you embed those tiny, edged trinkets into their hearts. When you pierce them with your Light. And it is captivating.

But Earth casts no Shadow. Not yet.

When you're ready, you will be magnificent. A Guardian of Guardians. Shadow of Shadows.

I reserve the right to be last when the end comes, and for that, I need you with me.

You're so close.

â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</pre></p>
