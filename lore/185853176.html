A CRUCIBLE STORY<br/>PART ONE OF THREE<br/><br/>"I beat you fair," Cayde said. "Don't ever—"<br/><br/>He raised his hand high to wag a finger under Shaxx's nose.<br/><br/>"—try to outrace my Golden Guns."<br/><br/>Two children ran by in a blur, laughing.<br/><br/>Shaxx shook his head slowly. "It was a tactical error. Won't happen again."<br/><br/>"Next time doesn't matter. You lost today, and today you owe me."<br/><br/>The Titan stared down at the Hunter, but said nothing, his hands clenched in fists. Cayde ignored the posturing and turned to face a desolate field of dirt and large rocks. A writhing mob of children spread across it, clusters of them barreling into each other as they bellowed and screamed. A much smaller number of elders waded in the chaotic sea of miniature people.<br/><br/>"What is this? What's happening?" Shaxx demanded.<br/><br/>"This City has children. Children who must stay within designated safe zones." The two Guardians watched as a boy climbed the largest rock on the field, about four feet in the air, and howled at the sky. "Of course they're gonna go a little stir-crazy. Parents bring them out to this—you'd think it would have a name—this field every month, and they have at it. Better they hit each other than climb the walls."<br/><br/>Shaxx stared at them.</p>
