<h2>Mark of the Emperor's Champion</h2>
<p>
Did you know Ghaul once fought as a gladiator? He was so striking and differentâ€¦ yes, because of his strange color and markings, but also his movement. He weaved through his opponents, tying together the thread of a grand design only he could see. <br/><br/>There was no opponent too large or powerful for Ghaul; his determination was everything. I see that strength in you, my dear Titan.</p>
