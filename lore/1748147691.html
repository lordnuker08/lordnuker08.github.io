<h1>Shadow Trespass</h1>
</div>
<p>
From the journals of Beatrix Danai, Pilot<br/><br/>Elsie Bray designed this shipâ€”she was even at the naming ceremony. I wasn't the pilot of the ship back then. Back then there wasn't even a war to worry about. That was the Golden Age, and it's as if all anybody ever did was improve themselves, expand knowledge, build amazing machines, and eat lotus or whatever you do in endless paradise.<br/><br/>But I'll tell you what, those dark panels? Those avoid detection by other ships' sensors. Which kind of makes you wonder, why did she design something so great for war in a time of peace? Maybe for some people, perfection in the Golden Age meant developing something like perfect vision of just what could become of Humankind. Not all of it would be pretty.</p>
