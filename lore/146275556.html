Venus. The Great Hunt.<br/><br/>The Ahamkara refused to die. For a day, Wei-Ning had been fighting it to a standstill with her bare hands, cratering it repeatedly into the ground. Eris had seen wish-dragons drive Titans mad by refusing to fall to brute strength. But Eris was pretty sure Wei-Ning was already insane.<br/><br/>"Confession time," the Titan said, as she hammered punches into the Ahamkara's tentacled face. "I've been wishing this fight would go on forever."<br/><br/>Eris balked. "Please stop, you psychopath. We have six others to handle!"<br/><br/>"No, no. We want this. Trust me," Wei-Ning said.<br/><br/>An hour later, six shapes emerged from the Venusian foliage. Ahamkara. Their compatriot, whom Wei-Ning continued to pound into the ground, was pulsating, growing stronger. Feeding. The others had come to feast at the same table.<br/><br/>Eris pulled her Arc Blade from the air and Blinked.<br/><br/>When the Hunter and the Titan finished their hunt, Eris thought she heard Wei-Ning whisper.<br/><br/>"Did you say something?"<br/><br/>"I was about to ask you."<br/><br/>"Huh."</p>
