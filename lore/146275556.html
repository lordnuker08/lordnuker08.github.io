Eris had seen wish-dragons drive Titans mad by refusing to fall to brute strength. But Eris was pretty sure Wei-Ning was already insane.<br/><br/>"Confession time," the Titan said, as she hammered punches into the Ahamkara's tentacled face. "I've been wishing this fight would go on forever."<br/><br/>Eris balked. "Please stop, you psychopath. We have six others to handle!"<br/><br/>"No, no. We want this.
