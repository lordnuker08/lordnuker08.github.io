<h1>Message from Aunor VIII</h1>
<div/>
<p>
CORMORANT-LEVEL ENCRYPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS. AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.<br/><br/>Drifter wants a bullet to the head? If not for the Vanguard decree, I'd oblige tonight.<br/><br/>Your trip to Titan let me round up a couple wannabe Dredgens out on the Tangled Shore. No casualties, civilian or Guardian. And a half dozen perps and their Ghosts restrained. Drifter was paying them to transport Motes to the Shore.<br/><br/>If Motes of Dark stay in Gambit, there's nothing I can do. Vanguard decree means Drifter is free and clear. As soon as I see anyone carry Motes outside that context, going to anyone but our rat in green? Their Light belongs to me.<br/><br/>Those six will face Praxic justice. Perhaps exile. We haven't had to lock anyone up in decades.<br/><br/>If the Vanguard thinks the Drifter hasn't changed things, I can't help them. And we'll continue to clean up their messes.<br/><br/>You're doing good work. Praxic work. If you're going to continue, I need you to keep attending Drifter's games. You're my eyes. He'll allow it. The man's desperate. Probably has been his whole life.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'm looking into the Nine again. The Haul was enough impetus, but that voice you heard? That was their Emissary. I don't know much about her, but she's wrapped up in this mess somehow.</p>
