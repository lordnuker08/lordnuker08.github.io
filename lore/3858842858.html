"What? Already?"

"It hasn't been three hours, has it?"

"Yeah."

"Hey, Lynn. Lynn. Hello?" 

"Sorry. Um. Was in the deep end there. What's up?"

"Firewall says our shift is over."

"Huh? That's what my datastem says. I guess so."

"Yeah, but does that feel right to you? And where's the relief team?

"Firewall, where's the next shift?"

AI-COM/FRWL//INBOUND.

"Yeah, but they should be here by now. Nobody is late for a shift."

"Hey, let's not worry about it. As long as they're late, let's just stay tuned until they get here."

"You want to be in reverie in when they arrive?"

"Their loss. They're the ones who are late."

"Nah. I don't want to start another fight."

"Lynn's right. Their loss. Firewall, give us another exit alert two minutes before the relief team arrives"

"Hey! You guys are in our seats."

"You're late."
