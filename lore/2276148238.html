But why?<br/>[silence]<br/>[oa:03] Dying up there won't bring her back, you know.<br/>[silence]<br/>[oa:04] Sorry. That wasn't… I'm sorry. Sometimes I say—<br/>[e3:01] You're honest, Omar. It's a quality I very much admire. So, allow me to be honest in return.<br/>[e3:02] We're going back, because we have found a way to destroy Crota. The Vanguard is too cowardly to use it.<br/>[oa:05] Cowardly?<br/>[e3:03] You know it's true. We hide behind the Wall as if it would save us, but what if Crota decided to descend?<br/>[e3:04] What if Crota and his armies landed in the City? How many more would die?<br/>[oa:06] But if Crota were to attack us, couldn't we defeat him here?<br/>[e3:05] No. The only means of destroying him is up there.<br/>[oa:07] Then why won't the Vanguard agree to—<br/>[e3:06] Eris and I went to Toland—<br/>[oa:08] Eris? Eris Morn?<br/>[e3:07] She sent me.<br/>[oa:09] Why the hell didn't you just say so? Let's go.</p>
