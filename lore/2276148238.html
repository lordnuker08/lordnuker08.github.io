But why?<br/>[silence]<br/>[oa:03] Dying up there won't bring her back, you know.<br/>[silence]<br/>[oa:04] Sorry. That wasn't… I'm sorry. Sometimes I say—<br/>[e3:01] You're honest, Omar. It's a quality I very much admire. So, allow me to be honest in return.<br/>[e3:02] We're going back, because we have found a way to destroy Crota.
