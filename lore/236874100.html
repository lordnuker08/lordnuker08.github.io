<h2>Batteries Not Included</h2>
<p>
What follows are simple things. Use each as needed. Use each as you will.<br/><br/>These are not your strength, but may they bolster your might when the weight of expectation falls down upon thee.<br/><br/>When the wars rage around you, find your peace.<br/>The Light is not of you, and you are not of the Light, and yet you are one.<br/>Give of yourself, and you will find all that you fear is missing.<br/>You are a hammer. You are a shield. Know the difference. Know yourself.<br/>Trust is a weapon. Handle with care.<br/>The burden is not yours alone, no matter the burden.<br/>Should Darkness call, answer true, and it will shrink from the Light.<br/>Wear your confidence with pride, but know it is a tool, not a weapon.<br/>Be mindful of the joy found in victory—it is earned but should never be the aim.<br/>For all you will see, all you discover—never lose the gift of curiosity.<br/>The Darkness would bend you to its will, but the Light bends to yours.<br/>Failure is an opportunity to learn.<br/>If the bones talk, do not listen.<br/>I am your guide and your friend, your ally and your tool. Use me.<br/>I will never leave you, but should I fall, remain vigilant, remain true.<br/><br/>This isn't the whole of my life advice, but it's something. We'll add more as we go along.<br/><br/>—An unknown Ghost's life advice for an unknown Guardian</p>
