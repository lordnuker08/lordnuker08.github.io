<h1>Qiao's Grin</h1>
<div/>
<p>
Qiao Supplemental<br/>Qiao's Journal<br/>Path to Ares: 18 Days to Launch<br/><br/>Mihaylova and Evie continue to have conflict that is completely unnecessary. It puts a strain on the Clubhouse. I know Jacob is trying to get a handle on it.<br/><br/>The latest is this ridiculous argument about the subroutines of the AI code. Evie wants to get a look at all of Mihaylova's code to make sure it takes into account the gravity measurements she's making to plot the possible movements of the Traveler.<br/><br/>Traveler—yes. Such a perfect name! Go Evie!<br/><br/>Anyway, Mihaylova simply refuses to unlock all of her code. Not outright, of course, she just deflects, underdelivers, won't let Evie into the whole thing.<br/><br/>I'm not interested in this conflict. I have my own ways of unlocking every piece of code in the onboard systems. So I gave Evie access.<br/><br/>I mentioned it afterwards to Mihaylova, and I expected her to react badly—but of course things don't always work out the way you expect. She got very quiet and said, "Well, Qiao. What's done is done."</p>
