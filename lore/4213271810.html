<h2>Blacklight Razor</h2>
<p>
Hey hey hey— <br/><br/>Hoping this finds you well, buddy! I gotta say those twin cutters do exactly what you said they did, pulling against each other and whipping the Sparrow forward constantly. It's like being on a slingshot. The thing vibrates constantly, but you get used to it after a while.<br/><br/>Here's the coolest thing, though—a few days ago, I had to move off a cliff and dive down 11,000 feet, and the thing literally cut the clouds, leaving swirls of mist around me as I went. It was beautiful.<br/><br/>Tell the guys at the shop that I'm happy and to take care of my little brother. He may have some other ideas for you.<br/><br/>Sail on,<br/>Rafael Rizz</p>
