<h2>Gwisin Vest</h2>
<p>
There is no self to kill;<br/>There is no end to life.<br/>The choices were made by someone else;<br/>The one who was who we were.<br/>We return, estranged, to act on them.<br/>We must stay unseen, like the ghosts we are:<br/>Take flight from the sun of living folk.<br/>Take the Ghost you were given—<br/>End the cycle that gave you birth;<br/>End those who killed you first.</p>
