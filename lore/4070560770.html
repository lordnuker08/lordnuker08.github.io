<h2>Gwisin Vest</h2>
<p><pre>There is no self to kill;
There is no end to life.
The choices were made by someone else;
The one who was who we were.
We return, estranged, to act on them.
We must stay unseen, like the ghosts we are:
Take flight from the sun of living folk.
Take the Ghost you were givenâ€”
End the cycle that gave you birth;
End those who killed you first.</pre></p>
