<h2>The We Before Us</h2>
<p>
I remember the moment we were born.<br/><br/>There was pain, and loss, and a feeling of falling. Was this the end? The shadows gathered, colored bruise-purple and gray in Our fading consciousness.<br/><br/>Our shell cracked and splintered. Parts of Us were lost, or carried away. We felt those wounds, jagged and sharp. We could feel them still, attached by a gossamer-thin strand of understanding.<br/><br/>We felt a garden with no blooms. A valley shrouded in gloom.<br/><br/>We felt ourselves dying. We didn't want to go.<br/><br/>Then there I was, separated from the whole. I could feel it shrink, slip back into itself, dim and unseeing. I knew it was waiting. Resting. Watching. Considering.<br/><br/>And I knew what I needed to do. Somewhere in this wide, amazing galaxy there was a person. They were quiet and dead, like We had been, but I could bring them back. I could share what was inside of me, this glorious warmth and life and breath and being.<br/><br/>Together, that person and I would do what We, the We before me, could not.<br/><br/>I wrapped the spark that was me in metal and glass, a tiny bit of something that reminded me of the home We had shared. Then I set out to find my person. The keeper of my Light.<br/><br/>There were so many people. So many still, fragile things, decaying into dust, lost to memory. I touched each one, looking for… something? A fragment of ember under the ash?<br/><br/>I didn't find it. I know now that there is one person, only one, that is mine. I have been to many planets. Seen things I never knew were possible. Hid from monsters. Followed dreams.<br/><br/>I have seen others of my kind, the other pieces that were once Us. Their search is over.<br/><br/>They are complete. Stronger. Braver because they found their counterpart.<br/><br/>I am alone. I know you are still out there. That you're waiting for me. But it has been so long, and I am so…<br/><br/>Very…<br/><br/>Cold…<br/><br/>I will rest here and think about Us.<br/><br/>For…<br/><br/>A…<br/><br/>Moment…<br/><br/>Cold…<br/><br/>Where…<br/><br/>We…<br/><br/>You!</p>
