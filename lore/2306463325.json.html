<h2>Symmetry Flight</h2>
<p><pre>I propose a simple experiment—look around. You see light. You see darkness. There could not be one without the other. They are two sides of the same coin. 

If it is true for these Newtonian echoes, why would it not be true of the purest, paracausal forms? 

Therefore, I conclude: the reason you persecute me is not because of the symmetry. It's because of the truth beyond this truth, the truth which you most dread: if we could destroy darkness, but we had to give up our Light to do so, how many of us would make that trade?</pre></p>
