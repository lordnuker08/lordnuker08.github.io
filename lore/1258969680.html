<h2>Noble Constant Mark</h2>
<p>
“We are history. We hold something that the Traveler wanted us to keep. Our charge is simple: Protect the Light. <br/><br/>Be the candle in the darkness of these days. Be the light the world sees. Be the wall against which evil breaks. Be the defenders the people of this City need. Bring hope, bring protection, bring victory.  <br/><br/>We are Titans. A choice was made to bring us here to fight together, and now that choice asks a new question: how will the history we are shape us into the legends we must become?” <br/><br/>—Zavala, Titan Vanguard</p>
