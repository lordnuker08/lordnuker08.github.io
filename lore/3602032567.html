She is home.<br/><br/>But it is not the same.<br/><br/>Shuro Chi has been Taken. Kalli and Sedia, too.<br/><br/>And Rivenâ€”<br/><br/>She used to sit in the shade of those wings. Laugh at the riddles that rumbled in that mercurial throat.<br/><br/>This creature is all teeth and broken promises, transformed by the expectations of another scheming, secretive sister.<br/><br/>"I cannot stay here."<br/><br/>These are the first words that pass through this throat.

They scrape and ache as they pass through her lips.<br/><br/>Again, if only to remind herself that she is alive:<br/><br/>"I cannot stay here."</p>
