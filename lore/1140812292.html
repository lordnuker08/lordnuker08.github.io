[Report by VanNet encrypted router.]<br/><br/>It preaches the philosophy of the Books of Sorrow, Yor's scriptures, and the unveiled fragments. The Traveler is a false creator, guarding its creations with false law. We are dead things made in the shape of the dead. The only true law is violent winnowing. Whatever cannot hold on to existence does not deserve existence. And so forth.<br/><br/>At least it is consistent.<br/><br/>[Personal notes, scratched in Hive leather with a flake of Ionian stone.]<br/><br/>The enemy suggests that our rebirth was an evil mistake. How Gnostic—they were a cult (a fleet? a school? a horde?) who believed that the source of all suffering was not in our poor choices but an error of the world's Creator. A false, deluded god. Mara would laugh, or weep.<br/><br/>Was my rebirth an evil?<br/><br/>It is true that Guardians are reborn to face pain. We are endlessly besieged by a tortured cosmos. Secretly, I believe that most of us fall to exhaustion. Our Ghosts love us and let us curl up inside, to rest.<br/><br/>My Ghost Brya died to save me. If she were returned… would I want immortality again?<br/><br/>I do fear immortality without choice. I would not want to go on as a prisoner in Vex glass, or a spirit trapped in the Sea of Screams…<br/><br/>But my life is not a prison or a trap.<br/><br/>[Deep cuts, full of stone dust:]<br/><br/>It is NOT.</p>
