<h2>The Mountaintop</h2>
<p>
[Fireteam leaders: Do not advance on the Wall. Fall back to the Ridgeback District.]<br/><br/>Shaxx freezes with a Vandal's windpipe in his fist. He waits for Saladin to justify the strategy.<br/><br/>[I repeat: All teams rally at the Ridgeback District. Do NOT advance. The City is lost.]<br/><br/>Shaxx drops the Vandal, then empties the rest of his clip into a Captain. He and his fireteam are running on fumes. The dead, Fallen and Guardian alike, litter the Twilight Gap. <br/><br/>[Shaxx! Do you copy?]<br/><br/>He risks a look over his shoulder at their home, the place they call the Last Safe City. Not burning. Not yet. Gritting his teeth, he reloads.<br/><br/>[Shaxx, your orders are to retreat.]<br/><br/>He sees a gap in the onslaught of invaders and gestures to the others. "Nkechi! Take Abdi and Truce. Liu Feng, with me! Bray! Cover us!"<br/><br/>[This battlefield is not your stage, Shaxx! This is not about glory!]<br/><br/>His fireteam doesn't hesitate.<br/><br/>[Shaxx! For the final time: Fall! Back!]<br/><br/>As the six of them crest the Wall, Shaxx cuts the feed.</p>
