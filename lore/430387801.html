<h2>Chrysopelea-S</h2>
<p>
Sure, we've had you covered on the ground with our impressive arsenal of apex munitions for some time, but VEIST recognizes when it's time to step up the game.<br/><br/>Now, we're elevating the fight to new horizons with our Chrysopelea-S, possessing all the attributes you've come to expect from the Last City's leading foundry. This noxious wonder makes the skies friendly again, with weapons-grade onboard AI, defensive lateral undulation flight patterns, and a cockpit cozier than a hug from a python.<br/><br/>Your enemies (probably your friends too) will be seething with jealousy when you take off faster than a Viper's strike. Shed your old ride and slide into the Chrysopelea-S. It'll feel like a brand new skin.</p>
