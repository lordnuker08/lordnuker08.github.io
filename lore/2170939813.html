<h2>Mihaylova's Triumph</h2>
<p>
Mihaylova Supplemental<br/>Navigator's Journal—Encrypted Supplemental—<br/>Path to Ares: 20 days to Launch<br/><br/>The situation with E becomes increasingly tenuous. She insists she needs access to all the AI code for her gravity well measurements, which I find highly unlikely. It's simply not necessary and I've given her all the subroutine code that she could possibly need.<br/><br/>But she wants it all. It's absurd. What would she make of the R subsystems if she saw them?<br/><br/>R. That's what I've code-named the deepest core of the experimental AI at the heart of the new ship. And he's doing very well, now writing his own code. Off-the-charts well.<br/><br/>Would E even understand? Likely she'd go running to Hardy, show him some of the odder items where R has written some of his own code and seems to be—how can I put it? —passing judgment on us, like a little hidden critic. No. The AI must be protected so that he can function best in the limited way we need.<br/><br/>Not sure how to keep her away, but giving her access could be catastrophic.</p>
