Because it would be better if Hardy could take the ship in his hands.<br/><br/>Project Catamaran was secret and probably dead as soon as it started. Crazy, to run out and meet something like that.<br/><br/>It was good work. Most of the AI code I started there didn't really get used for the mission but it came in handy.
