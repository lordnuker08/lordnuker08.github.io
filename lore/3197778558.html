<h2>Mihaylova's Path</h2>

File: Mihaylova, Engineer, Ares One<br/>Path to Ares: Unknown date<br/>—Supplemental—<br/>Old Russia Agency of Technology & Science<br/>Documentary Interview<br/>—partially recovered—<br/><br/>Mihaylova: —had to start a lot of that over.<br/><br/>Insurance Agent: Let's talk about your background. You were one of the heroes of the Ares One, right?<br/><br/>M: Heroes! Ha! No, no. We were scientists.<br/><br/>IA: Very well. So as a scientist, the system you designed—<br/><br/>M: I designed the AI.<br/><br/>IA: And did the AI run the mission?<br/><br/>M: Oh, no, it couldn't have back then. We had no idea what we were going to find. Moon X was a terraformer; we could run into oceans, storms… and indeed, landing was a mess.<br/><br/>So we needed the best AI with extreme flexibility. Because it would be better if Hardy could take the ship in his hands.<br/><br/>Project Catamaran was secret and probably dead as soon as it started. Crazy, to run out and meet something like that.<br/><br/>It was good work. Most of the AI code I started there didn't really get used for the mission but it came in handy. I mean, where do you think—</p>
