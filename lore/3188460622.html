<h2>Null Calamity 9</h2>
<p>
"I've misplaced Osiris again," Sagira told a Goblin.<br/><br/>The Goblin, being a Goblin, shot at her.<br/><br/>She dodged with a sigh, and continued through the Forest.<br/><br/>"If I was Osiris, where would I go to celebrate Panoptes becoming scrap metal?"<br/><br/>The answer, when Sagira finally tracked him down, surprised her.<br/><br/>Osiris hovered, cross-legged, at the center of a ruined Lighthouse. A dead sun loomed in the lightless sky. Arrayed on the ground below to the horizon, yellow Vex eyes pierced the gloom. <br/><br/>Sagira zoomed straight to Osiris's side. "I thought we averted this future!"<br/><br/>Eyes closed, Osiris shook his head. "Many equations lead to this answer."<br/><br/>A sound like a drumbeat, but with the impact of an earthquake, shook the Lighthouse.<br/><br/>Sagira darted through the crumbling chamber. "What do we do?"<br/><br/>Another bone-rattling drumbeat kicked up clouds of dust.<br/><br/>Osiris floated to his feet. "We start over."<br/><br/>BOOM. Through the window, a shadow eclipsed the Vex eyes. <br/><br/>"But first," he said. "You'll have to rez me again, old friend."</p>
