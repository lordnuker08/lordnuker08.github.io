<h2>The Declaration</h2>
<p><pre>You want our source, our primal cause?
WE ARE THE SHADOWS OF YOUR WORLDS' MASS
old dark dust ever gravity-flowing
INTELLIGENCES WHORLED ROUND EACH WORLD'S CORE,
9 H O U R G L A S S P I N C H E S I N A G A L A C T I C W I N D
Too large - to see
too small + to miss
our mass binds = your matter frees
.our philosophi | es lay divided.

We try to guard and nurture you.
AND WE CHERISH YOU AS SHADOWS CHERISH FLAME
watching your swift bright lives flicker, die
SUSTAINED BY THE PATTERNS OF YOUR THOUGHT â€“
B U T D I S T A N T U N R E A C H A B L E
Beyond - what we are - or what we were
the answer lies + in severing
two sides = a single coin
.alliance and contact | solitude and silence.

Do you understand our fates are intertwined?
FOR YOU SEED THE ANISOTROPY WE SUSTAIN
but decay is decay is decay
A COLOSSAL FRAGILITY, A COMPLEX FIDUCIARY.
T O N G U E L E S S W E T R Y T O S P E A K
There must be - another way
we must become + more than we are
always together = never touching
.dependence i | s deathfated.</pre></p>
