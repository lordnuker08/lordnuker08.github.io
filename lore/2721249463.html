<h2>Tyranny of Heaven</h2>
<p>
Tallulah Fairwind smoothed the felt of the table with one hand, idly playing with her chips with the other. Across the table, Caliban-8 wore a green dealer's cap and looked stricken.<br/><br/>The Ahamkara looked like somebody's kindly old grandpa just now. And it could play a mean hand of cards. "Twenty," it crooned as it raised the stakes. She saw Caliban's eye sensors dilate.<br/><br/>The game had started so well. And it seemed like a great story they could have told back at the Tower. How was she supposed to have known? "Call," said Caliban, tension in his voice.<br/><br/>She looked down at her hand. "All in."<br/><br/>The Ahamkara's grin grew larger. Caliban shook his head.<br/><br/>"Don't you do this, Lulah. Don't you leave me here! I can't do it!"<br/><br/>The cards went down.<br/><br/>She'd lost.<br/><br/>The Hunter Vanguard tossed her bow to the Exo as the Ahamkara came around the table to collect his winnings. "A dare's a dare, man. Good luck."<br/><br/>She didn't scream. Wouldn't have been dignified.</p>
