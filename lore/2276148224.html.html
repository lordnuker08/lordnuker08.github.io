[oa:01] Hang on, does it make sense to you that Crota will be weaker in some reality he created?
[vt:01] It doesn't have to make sense. He just has to be stopped.
[oa:02] I know, but wouldn't you make a netherworld or whatever where you were invulnerable?
[vt:02] According to Toland—
[oa:03] Right, Toland. Why are we trusting anything that lunatic says?
[vt:03] I don't trust him. His highest loyalty is to knowledge. I trust you. I trust Eris and the others. I trust the Light in us.
[oa:04] A lot of Guardians brought their Light here. Are we any different?
[vt:04] They didn't know what Toland knows.
[oa:05] Toland again!
[vt:05] Toland again. I don't trust my weapons. I use them.
[silence]
[oa:06] Fair enough.</pre></p>
