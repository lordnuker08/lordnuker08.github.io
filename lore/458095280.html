<h2>Crest of Alpha Lupi</h2>
<p>
Near-gods must believe in greater gods. But every power is finite, every life shorter than it wishes. <br/><br/>Only an astonishing mind can truly appreciate just how tiny it is when set against the known universe; and how insignificant the known becomes when it is devoured by what isn't seen and can't be comprehended. <br/><br/>As darkness begins to claim their ragged souls, you look ahead to find a great power pouring out of youâ€”a face of fire and golden light. <br/><br/>That blazing wonder, a gift from the great-eyed god, is their salvation. Or are you? <br/>Perhaps you are the greater god now.</p>
