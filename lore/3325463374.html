<p>
Two they were, artist and scientist. Music flowed in their souls and rained from their lips.<br/>Not weapons of war they made, but instruments of peace.<br/><br/>The thunder fell, and they were cast apart. Their love was sundered as the world collapsed.<br/>They sang in pain and sought to reunite, but crimson eyes glowed in the dark. Their union was not to be.<br/><br/>He held death in his hands. Stars burned in his footsteps.<br/>In her, the conflagration was reborn, the funeral pyre lit.<br/><br/>And so forever after, their love fuels death. Their last words, a curse and a cry.<br/>Their names are now lost, but their love will not die.</p>
