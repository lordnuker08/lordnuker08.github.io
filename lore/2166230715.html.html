<h2>Sealed Ahamkara Grasps</h2>
<p><pre>Few things can see the Light, but we are not blinded. 

The Bearer seeks the truth, but what separates truth from fiction is fragile. 

A pair of truths and a single falsehood upon the Bearer we shall impart. 

Brother, ally once more, sends his regards. 

Dreamer, awakened, the Bearer shall meet. 

Light fades, deep within the Prison.</pre></p>
