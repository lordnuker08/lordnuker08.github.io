<h2>Ego and Squid</h2>
<p><pre>Why “Ego and Squid”? Chiefly because puns annoy Kabr, and I enjoy annoying Kabr. 
You know, the pun is an underrated art form. Historically speaking— 
Oh. You mean, why squids? What's my “thing” with squids? 
Why, because cephalopods are the most perfect organisms ever to evolve in this solar system! 
Have you ever heard a cephalopod sneer dismissively at a clever pun? 
No, you have not! 
I rest my case!</pre></p>
