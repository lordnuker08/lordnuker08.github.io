<h2>Ego and Squid</h2>
<p>
Why “Ego and Squid”? Chiefly because puns annoy Kabr, and I enjoy annoying Kabr. <br/>You know, the pun is an underrated art form. Historically speaking— <br/>Oh. You mean, why squids? What's my “thing” with squids? <br/>Why, because cephalopods are the most perfect organisms ever to evolve in this solar system! <br/>Have you ever heard a cephalopod sneer dismissively at a clever pun? <br/>No, you have not! <br/>I rest my case!</p>
