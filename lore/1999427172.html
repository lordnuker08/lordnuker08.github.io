<h2>Shadow's Mask</h2>
<p>
The Crown of Sorrow came from one of my Athenaeum worlds, a Hive repository.<br/><br/>It was one of you who helped me find it. One among your Hunter-tribe, of the Red War lineage. You may be younger than the Old Russians, but you have virility.<br/><br/>A whole network of library worlds just like that one has been lost to me and my Empire. It's been too long.<br/><br/>I'll call on you, one day, to help me reclaim them. Before the end comes.<br/><br/>—Emperor Calus</p>
