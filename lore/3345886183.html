<h2>Bond of Remembrance</h2>
<p>
A TALE FROM THE DARK AGE, PART THREE OF THREE<br/>THE OUTSKIRTS OF A TOWN CALLED PATCH RUN <br/><br/>Efrideet stands in a burning crater, the Light of her Ghost blinking rapidly, as if to chortle, over Saladin's corpse. Saladin suddenly sits up to a hunched-over position, hands on his knees in front of him. Dust from the demolished Spider Tank around them rolls off his armor and into the blowing wind.

"Where are they now?"<br/><br/>She makes no move to acknowledge his fear. "They never reached the village."<br/><br/>Saladin sits back at that. He grasps a large rock in his hand, focuses on it.
