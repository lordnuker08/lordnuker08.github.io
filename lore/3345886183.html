<h2>Bond of Remembrance</h2>
<p>
A TALE FROM THE DARK AGE, PART THREE OF THREE<br/>THE OUTSKIRTS OF A TOWN CALLED PATCH RUN <br/><br/>Efrideet stands in a burning crater, the Light of her Ghost blinking rapidly, as if to chortle, over Saladin's corpse. Saladin suddenly sits up to a hunched-over position, hands on his knees in front of him. Dust from the demolished Spider Tank around them rolls off his armor and into the blowing wind.
