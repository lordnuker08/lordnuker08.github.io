<h2>Wavesplitter</h2>
<p>
From the makers of the Coldheart comes the latest in breakthrough City Age technology: the Wavesplitter. Here are the three most frequently asked questions we get about our revolutionary weaponized sound system.<br/><br/>Q: If the Wavesplitter fires sound waves, does it need ammo packs?<br/><br/>A: The Wavesplitter does need ammo packs, but the onboard matter transmuter turns that ammo into electrical energy that powers the waveform emitter.<br/><br/>Q: What does it sound like when you're hit by it?<br/><br/>A: Our Guardian testers give us many different answers. Some say it sounds like a scream you hear in your bones. Others say it sounds like a dying star. Still others say it reminds them of a knife shaped like a B flat.<br/><br/>Q: Can the Wavesplitter be used as a musical instrument?<br/><br/>A: The Wavesplitter was not designed to be a musical instrument. That said, we at Omolon are in the business of giving Guardians options, not taking them away.</p>
