<h2>Regarding Phogoth, the Untamed</h2>
<p>
My Queen,<br/><br/>Abomination. The Untamed. Spawn of Crota. That's what we called him.<br/><br/>Phogoth was a creature bred for one purpose: destruction. The Hidden Swarm kept this Ogre alive through foul rituals of rebirth, chained up in the Summoning Pits, its unnatural existence a reminder of the threat the Swarm poses.<br/><br/>Yet, seeing its visage has sparked an unexpected emotion within me: pity.<br/><br/>I, too, know the pain of having to lead an existence you no longer want. The monster should have died and been forgotten. Instead, it had to live a life of indentured servitude. Sometimes, I feel the same. Though duty is my oath and privilege, I can't help but feel trapped by the endless cycle of the fight. Will it all be worth it in the end? Will I ever know peace?<br/><br/>Perhaps the Nightmares are weighing on me more than I'd care to admit, as these thoughts flood my mind and cloud my judgment. Even still, I remain steadfast in our mission, my Queen. Your endless support drives me, and for that, I am thankful.</p>
