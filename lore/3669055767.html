<h2>Kairos Function</h2>
<p>
Physically, I am beneath the surface of Mercury. That is what Sagira's sensors say. The Vex hollowed out the planet, replaced its molten heart with cold right angles.<br/><br/>But that is not what I see.<br/><br/>I see infinity.<br/><br/>An infinity of possible worlds, so perfectly simulated as to be indistinguishable from the experiences I once called "reality." I can touch them, taste them, pass lifetimes in them! They grow within this machine like fruit upon a tree—no, a forest of trees, its fractal expansion nigh unmeasurable.<br/><br/>I said that to Sagira and she replied, "Sounds like a challenge."<br/><br/>This Ghost of mine knows me too well.<br/><br/>It strikes me now that I could find in this Infinite Forest a reality in which Ikora accompanied me into its endless mysteries.<br/><br/>What an awful, destructive machine this is.<br/><br/>I must know everything about it.</p>
