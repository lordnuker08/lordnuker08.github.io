<h2>VI: Blood Sport</h2>
<p>
The congregation has departed.<br/><br/>Zulmak, impaled by a lesser blade, has failed.<br/><br/>The congregation is foolhardy.<br/><br/>Zulmak spins.<br/><br/>Lodged in his flesh, the blade snaps, its wielder now weaponless but for an edgeless grip.<br/><br/>Zulmak crushes the assailant with a single, mighty blow, but the damage is done.<br/><br/>The horde piles on, weighing him down. Cutting. Slicing.<br/><br/>The would-be champion is swallowed by the mass.<br/><br/>Across the Pit, the attention of the combatants shifts. They turn on each other. There is no more champion, so a new champion must claim victory. The sword logic demands it.<br/><br/>Beneath the mound of writhing bone and claw, those who rushed Zulmak poke and prod, killing all beneath their weight.<br/><br/>Then movement. And a terrible scream.<br/><br/>The heap quakes and pulses.<br/><br/>Then, a powerful thrust. Bodies fly, and an angry shape stomps forth.<br/><br/>Zulmak, impaled a dozen times, perhaps more—decorated in blade and hilt—roars.<br/><br/>All eyes fall upon him.<br/><br/>He slumps, breathes heavily, then stands.<br/><br/>The heap continues to writhe.<br/><br/>Zulmak climbs its uneven slope, crushing the weak underfoot.<br/><br/>Reaching the bony peak of bodies living and dead, the wounded champion issues a challenge—a gut-born, ragged battle cry.<br/><br/>Zulmak, the Impaled.<br/>Zulmak, the Unfelled.<br/>Zulmak, the Destroyer.<br/><br/>The horde charges.<br/><br/>Clambering to reach him, high above the pile.<br/><br/>And when they do, they offer themselves, one after another, to his devastating embrace—sacrificing themselves to the champion, to the logic.<br/><br/>They are not worthy.<br/><br/>But maybe—maybe—Zulmak is.</p>
