Widening the scan parameters. I got bupkis."<br/><br/>"Look for any kind of transmission, or a nearby audio device," Lisbon-13 ordered. "We're getting sound without a source."<br/><br/>"Got it," his Ghost said, but then it wobbled in the air. "Whoa. Don't got it."<br/><br/>Lisbon-13 grabbed his Ghost before it could fall. In the grotto, their Light faded.<br/><br/>He heard Rekkana ask, "Yardarm, Lisbon, you OK?"<br/><br/>"I'm fine," he said. And he was. Something strange—something alarming—was happening, but Lisbon-13 felt no fear.<br/><br/>As the gloom faded to black, Lisbon-13 set his shoulders. Whoever—whatever—it was had spoken. It would speak again.<br/><br/>Lisbon-13 stood against the dark and waited to have words.</p>
