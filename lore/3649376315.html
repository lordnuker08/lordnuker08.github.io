<h2>19: Reunion</h2>
<p>
Saint-14 watches vessels dip in and out of the hangar. The cadence of docking and disembarking ships finds rhythm in the busy city. It is routine. Practiced. Peaceful.<br/><br/>A visitor steps aboard the Gray Pigeon.<br/><br/>Geppetto turns to welcome them. "Greetings, Brother Osiris. You are a welcome sight. Is Sagira with you?"<br/><br/>"Hello Geppetto. Sagira visits Ikora." Osiris sits on the gangway of the Gray Pigeon. He runs a ribbon through his fingers. "Hello Saint."<br/><br/>"Osiris? I wondered if this meeting would be with one of your projections."<br/><br/>"I would not…"<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>"Quite the shrine they've made for you. Are you dying?"<br/><br/>Saint-14 laughs.<br/><br/>"It is good to see you again, Brother."</p>
