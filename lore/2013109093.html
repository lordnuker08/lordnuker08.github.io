<h2>Mask of the Emperor's Agent</h2>
<p>
I often think of what it would be like to see you againâ€”how you might look and what you might say. I imagine different scenarios where you walk around a corner and there I am, magnificent and in control. I don't see you at first, and you hesitate. Is this a confrontation you want to have? <br/><br/>Of course, your curiosity gets the better of you. Our eyes meet. Neither of us say anything, because we both know what's at stake. This could be the end of an empire.</p>
