<h1>Cloak of the Great Hunt</h1>
<div/>
<p>
The Great Disaster.<br/><br/>Years after the Hunt.<br/><br/>They are dead. Wei Ning. Eriana-3. Toland. Sai Mota. Omar. Vell Tarlowe.<br/><br/>Guardians live lives of loss. Everything around us inevitably turns to dust. When we come together, it's to war. Against enemies of humanity. Against each other.<br/><br/>One of our few comforts is the knowledge that our peers will be there tomorrow. For good or ill. My fireteam has been robbed of that.<br/><br/>I am lost in these lunar tunnels. Out of ammo. Short on Light. I am out of moves, save one. I clutch an Ahamkara bone in one hand, and my dead Ghost in the other. I hear a whisper.<br/><br/>My vision is gone. My face itches from the viscous flow from my eyes.<br/><br/>Though I can't see, I find that I suddenly know the way out.</p>
