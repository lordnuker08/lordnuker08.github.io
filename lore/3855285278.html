He dragged a Psion corpse with him so he'd have something to sit on.<br/><br/>He dumped the body to the ground, took a seat.<br/><br/>Drifter licked his finger and slid it behind a hidden panel on the bank's outer shell to crack the thing open. It unfolded, ejecting a single, compressed Mote.<br/><br/>A Mote of Dark, he called it. He could see it glow despite the shining sun overhead. It was chill to the touch, an effect of the bank.
