"Nah. Dark Age version was better."<br/><br/>"You and I remember the Dark Age differently."<br/><br/>"I'll take a hard projectile over energy any day. No better way to make sure the target is dead."<br/><br/>"Energy is for silencing barriers. Fists are all I need to administer blunt-force trauma."<br/><br/>"I forget you used to be a Warlord."<br/><br/>"What do you mean 'used to?'"<br/><br/>"I thought you'd thrown in with Saladin and Felwinter."<br/><br/>"I did. But I never stopped being me."<br/><br/>"Then whyâ€”"<br/><br/>"'Warlord' is too many syllables."<br/><br/>"Gambit needs more candidates like you. Should stop by sometime. Whatever you want to call yourself."<br/><br/>"Thank you. You're a liar and a cheat. Stay out of my Crucible."</p>
