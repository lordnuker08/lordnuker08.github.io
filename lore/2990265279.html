<h2>EMPTINESS</h2>
<p>
I.I<br/>Any who fear knowledge are empty of purpose. Be unlike them. Be their rival.<br/><br/>I.II<br/>Become the destroyer of hollow things.<br/><br/>I.III<br/>None are equal to those who tread upon existence in search of impossible eternity.<br/><br/>I.IV<br/>All who fail to strive beyond the known are lacking in truest meaning.<br/><br/>I.V<br/>Your enemies would taint all you hold dear—they know no other way.<br/><br/>I.VI<br/>Emotion is not required when removing obstacles from your path.<br/><br/>I.VII<br/>Obstructions are either ignorant of the greater good, or actively against it. Destroy them.<br/><br/>"To rend one's enemies is to see them not as equals, but objects—hollow of spirit and meaning."<br/>—13th Understanding, 7th Book of Sorrow<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>The ruse worked. Cull's radical speech gathered the weaker among our number—a splinter group of radical Shadows hellbent on worshiping Darkness and bending to its will. He preached a doctrine of hate empowered by total corruption, and the lesser minds who flocked to our purpose were drawn in like flies to filth. More important—the Renegade took the bait, turned many to ash. Turned Cull to ash. A failing on two fronts. First, Cull's sacrifice bought us time and distance. Second, it rallied many of our newest recruits against the Renegade. Sides are being chosen, and Vale's recording of Cull's death will draw those most eager to tempt Darkness.<br/><br/>All is proceeding as we envision. <br/><br/>—hand-scrawled note accompanying Teben Grey's personal translation of ancient Hive text</p>
