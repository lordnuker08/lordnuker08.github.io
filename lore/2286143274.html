<h2>The Huckleberry</h2>
<p>
We used to play for keeps. Used to be that was the only way.<br/>Back in those days trust came slow, or not at all. The only thing you could truly rely on was the iron at your side.<br/>Fate of the world? Immortal gods?<br/>Don't know much 'bout that.<br/>But when everything's on the line, it's quality that counts.<br/>Tex Mechanica: we play by the old rules, the best rules.<br/>We play for keeps.</p>
