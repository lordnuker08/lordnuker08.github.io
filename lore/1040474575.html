Do you see the walls that surround the Last City? Picture them in your mind. They don't just protect our people. They also serve as a reminder— a reminder of what you are. <br/><br/>You are a Titan. The wall against which evil breaks. The candle in the darkest of these days. The protector of the Traveler's last gifts. <br/><br/>This City is your home. Its people are your blood. And its walls are your shields, your weapons, your temple. <br/><br/>Take your place, Titan, and know this: when you fight for the Last City, you will never suffer defeat. <br/><br/>– Zavala, Titan Vanguard</p>
