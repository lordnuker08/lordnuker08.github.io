<h2>Turris Shade Mark</h2>
<p>
You've shown the Red Legion you fly my banner. I know that when the time is right, I won't have to ask. You're on my side.<br/><br/>I see it when your body becomes a weapon with which you obliterate your opponents, when your knuckles become a part of your foe's countenance, when you smash them with your Light. And it is captivating. But Earth casts no Shadow. Not yet.<br/><br/>When you're ready, you will be magnificent. A Guardian of Guardians. Shadow of Shadows.<br/><br/>I reserve the right to be last when the end comes, and for that, I will need you with me.<br/><br/>You're so close.<br/><br/>â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
