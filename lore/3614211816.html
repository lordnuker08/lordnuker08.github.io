<h2>Plate of the Great Hunt</h2>
<p>
Joxer checked the safety on his rifle for the ninth time.<br/><br/>Illyn of the Techeun stepped out of the greyness before him. A massive, coffin-shaped container levitated at her side.<br/><br/>"You won't need that," Illyn said of the rifle.<br/><br/>Joxer kept it in his hands.<br/><br/> "All that Light and still your key motivation is fear. It's fear that drives you to ask the Queen for help."<br/><br/>"The Ahamkara are blasting and paving entire regions of Venus," he said.<br/><br/>"They wouldn't be so base. They're re-writing Venus."<br/><br/>"Whatever. It's a problem I can't punch. Do you have guns that will help, or not?"<br/><br/>The massive container lowered itself before the Titan. Illyn lifted the lid and pale cosmic light from within reflected off Joxer's eyes.<br/><br/>"Long rifles. Close quarters weapons. Silent killers in the night. All yours to borrow. You must return these when your Hunt is complete."<br/><br/>"Why?" Joxer frowned.<br/><br/>"Those are the conditions of her bargain. Take it or leave it."<br/><br/>"Her? The Queen?"<br/><br/>Illyn didn't respond.<br/><br/>Joxer took the entire container on his back.</p>
