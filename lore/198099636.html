<h2>BrayTech Researcher's Hood</h2>
<p>
"Thirty-six field units have been equipped with the new adaptive lens polarization system (ALPS). This version of ALPS leverages the eye-tracking target acquisition algorithm present in some of our scout and tactical units. This integration allows for near-instantaneous adjustment based on head position, ocular focal depth, and the light's angle of incident."<br/><br/>—BrayTech Internal Memo</p>
