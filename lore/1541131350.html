<h2>Cerberus+1</h2>
<p>
I had plans for the Photonic Heart.<br/><br/>First I was gonna take it straight to Marcus, gloat for a bit. "Look what I found, told you the rumors were true, how fast d'you think my Sparrow'd go if I swapped my engine out for it…"<br/><br/>Then see what I could get for it in the Bazaar. Not 'cause I wanted to sell it. Just 'cause it'd feel good to know.<br/><br/>Then I was gonna take a little vacation with it to Venus, and THEN I'd figure out what to do with it. At my leisure.<br/><br/>But no. Had to get sucker punched by an asteroid.<br/><br/>Barely made the landing on this dusty spit of Shore. Lost all my weapons in the crash. Heart only survived 'cause I put it in my helmet and buckled it in my seat.<br/><br/>So my Ghost revives me, and there I am in a crater surrounded by fragmentalized auto rifles and a Golden Age microstellar dynamo. Talk about hell.<br/><br/>I started with three barrels. Figured I might as well lean into the hell vibe. Shoulda known that wouldn't have been enough to really min/max with a power source this feisty. Especially once I noticed the coronal containment shield was cracked.<br/><br/>The first time I fired the Cerberus+1 and felt that puppy kick, I knew: plans are overrated.</p>
