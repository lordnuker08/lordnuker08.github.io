<h2>Mask of Sekris</h2>
<p>
Sekris, the Baron of Shanks, wore this last. He was the most venerated warrior-priest of his era; Taniks, the Scarred and a whole generation of mercenaries to come patterned their brutality after his early, worlds-burning deeds. But I reached out, and he disappeared from history when he ventured into the deep black, following an offer he could not ignore.<br/><br/> â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
