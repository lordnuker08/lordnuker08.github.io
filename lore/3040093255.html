<h2>Regarding Crota, Son of Oryx</h2>
<p>
My Queen,<br/><br/>The worst is upon us. I'm afraid… struggling to control my emotions, my Queen. But it is not fear that provokes me.<br/><br/>Uncontrollable rage fills me as the Nightmare of Crota returns to taunt me for my failures once again. I am always failing.<br/><br/>The countless lives taken during the Great Disaster, my fireteam, and my own lost humanity—they have all come rushing back. I am trying in vain to stop a waterfall with a tree branch. I am overwhelmed. I fail again.<br/><br/>The Eater of Hope laid waste to world after world in his pursuit of the Traveler. My friends… His sword stole their Light. Their. Light.<br/><br/>There was never a path to forgiveness with Crota. He had to be… eradicated.<br/><br/>The peace I felt learning of his demise at the hands of Guardians was immeasurable. I took pleasure in his death. I relished in it.<br/><br/>The Darkness will win. I can sense it already.<br/><br/>I swore I would go on. I can no longer swear this. Always failing.<br/><br/>Relieve me.</p>
