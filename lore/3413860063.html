<h2>Lord of Wolves</h2>
<p>
"Why did they call themselves Wolves?" the Hunter asks. "You guys don't have any wolves on your home world, do you?"<br/><br/>"Nama," the Captain replies. He has perched on a rusted-out Skiff. He scans the horizon, trying to remember the way to the crypt.<br/><br/>"So… Why, then? Most people haven't even seen one."<br/><br/>"Yeah," the Warlock chimes in. "I'd never even heard of wolves 'til I went to the Iron Temple."<br/><br/>The Captain cocks his head in a way that makes him look very like a squat, hulking owl. "Why Eliksni accept name 'Fallen'? Why Wolves accept name 'Wolves'? Why Misraaks is now," he grimaces as he mimes their accents, showing his serrated teeth, "Miff-racks?" He rises in one fluid motion and stands at his full height. "Why speak Guardian way instead Eliksni? Docked things do not word themselves."<br/><br/>He hops down, brushing past the Hunter and the Warlock with the rippling strength of a hunting tiger. "House of Wolves, they been Mraskilaasan. Gentle weavers. Come. I know the way now."</p>
