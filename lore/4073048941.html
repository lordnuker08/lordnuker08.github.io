"Y'know," said Cenric, a thick-necked Risen with a bulging vein in his forehead, "I've always thought you were a sneak. But after five drinks on your dime, I'm feeling pretty fond of you, Drifter."<br/><br/>Everyone laughed. Drifter smiled, feet kicked up on the bar. The rifle holstered on his back was heavy with promise.<br/><br/>"You're a real smooth talker," he said. "I wonder… You whisper those same sweet nothings to your pal Lord Rience?"<br/><br/>The bar fell quiet. The vein in Cenric's forehead began to twitch. <br/><br/>"Listen, no one's rockin' the boat here," Jaak spoke up. "We shut Rience out, just like you said."<br/><br/>"Funny. I seen you in that valley, too. And Otto, and Ayrin, and Thalia…" He looked at them each in turn. "Guess my eyes are playing tricks on me."<br/><br/>Cenric pushed his stool back. "You have something to say, say it plain."<br/><br/>"Well, Cen—my eyes might be shot, but this…" He tapped the side of his nose. "Just fine. And I smell a rat." He sniffed. "A whole mess of 'em, actually."<br/><br/>Cenric stood up. That vein of his looked about ready to pop. Drifter let his feet down as he reached for his rifle, asp-quick. "And you know what we do with rats, don't you, brother."</p>
