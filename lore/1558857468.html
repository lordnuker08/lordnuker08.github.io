"I see three half-finished Sparrows in this room alone, and you still haven't done that thing Ikora asked you to do. You're plenty busy."<br/><br/>Marcus tilted his head to glare at his Ghost. "Didi. Be serious."<br/><br/>"I am."<br/><br/>Marcus groaned.<br/><br/>"Fine." Didi floated over to the wall where Marcus's bright red Sparrow-racing jacket dangled from a hook. "You know, I've always wanted one of these. For me."<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Is that weird?"<br/><br/>"No!" Marcus jumped to his feet. "It's aces. Of course you need a racing shell. I'm going to make you the flashiest shell you've ever seen." He grabbed his Ghost out of the air and kissed her shell. "Thank you, Didi!"<br/><br/>"You're the one—never mind." Didi bumped her Guardian's forehead affectionately. "You're welcome, Marcus."</p>
