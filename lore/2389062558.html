<h2>Contraverse Hold</h2>
<p>
FROM THE WRITINGS OF TOMEK<br/><br/>All things have a cost. But what if I didn't have to be the one to pay it?<br/><br/>The many-worlds theory may be out of fashion among my peers, but the fanatical beliefs of the Future War Cult don't come from nowhere.<br/><br/>I remember the exact moment I realized: If I was investigating ways to make my parallel selves carry my burdens, then surely those Tomeks had already had the same idea.<br/><br/>I had no way of knowing the others' progress. But each time I bent my head over my workbench, I felt the gaze of infinite eyes upon my shoulders.<br/><br/>In the end, I and one other activated our inventions at the exact same space-time coordinates.<br/><br/>It came down to a cosmic coin toss. One of us became the owner of the powerful Contraverse Hold.<br/><br/>And I became a battery.</p>
