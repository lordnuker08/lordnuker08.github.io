<p>
I think it is only fair to warn youâ€”I mean to reincorporate the Red Legion. I am their rightful emperor, and I shall offer them forgiveness. All they must do is repent and submit to their reeducation. <br/><br/>I feel like it's only fair to make you the same offer. How does "Primus of the Red Legion" sound?</p>
