He had been reduced to crawling. His Ghost cut serenely through the air above him.<br/><br/>"What the hell is wrong with me?" he demanded of the ground.<br/><br/>"You're dying from starvation," Ghost said flatly.<br/><br/>"I don't believe you," he sneered, as he dragged himself over some rocks.<br/><br/>"I could fix you," Ghost said.<br/><br/>"Don't need you," he said. "I got this."<br/><br/>"You're not going to pick a name?" Ghost asked. "Everyone picks a name."<br/><br/>"You talk too much."<br/><br/>"Some people pick names for their Ghosts, too. What should I call you, if you don't want a name?"<br/><br/>He had passed out. The sun beat down directly overhead, a searing marble in the sky. He died a day later after a scorpion stung his prone body. Ghost allowed it. A complete restart would be less complicated.<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>He opened his eyes and took an even breath. "What should I call you?" Ghost asked.<br/><br/>He looked at it, as if considering. Then down at his hands.<br/><br/>"I'm still hungry."</p>
