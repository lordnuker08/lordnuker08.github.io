<h2>Entries 170, 171</h2>
<p>
Entry 170<br/><br/>Last night, the peace of the refugee camp abruptly ended. Thunder and lightning reverberated in our ears. The people with drones fought a battle in the camp against other people with drones. She and I took this opportunity to escape by following the shoreline for a few miles.<br/><br/>I know why they're here. I recognized one of them. The man from before. The one with the red drone. The one who killed Yuki.<br/><br/>They are here for the Obsidian Accelerator. We have to leave.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Entry 171<br/><br/>We watched the camp burn from the cliffs. I saw the people with the drones fan out in all directions. I could follow the paths they cut through the darkness by the flickering of their drones' light.<br/><br/>There's no time for anything else, and despite her concerns, she has opened up to me.<br/><br/>I'm removing the Obsidian Accelerator and sending her down the road. They can come and get it from me. Not her.<br/><br/>This is likely goodbye…</p>
