<h2>The Armamentarium</h2>
<p><pre>True freedom is an iron-clad lock
And the most useful key, a rock
The tastiest spice is hunger
And the truest certaintyâ€”wonder. 

The best repair is but destruction, 
The purest ignorance, instruction
The safest shelter is an offensive, 
And to fall in battle is true ascension

Brothers and sisters, bear thy arms and be merry
To the front, to battle!
Defeat is a sickness and we've found the cure</pre></p>
