<h2>The Armamentarium</h2>
<p>
True freedom is an iron-clad lock<br/>And the most useful key, a rock<br/>The tastiest spice is hunger<br/>And the truest certaintyâ€”wonder. <br/><br/>The best repair is but destruction, <br/>The purest ignorance, instruction<br/>The safest shelter is an offensive, <br/>And to fall in battle is true ascension<br/><br/>Brothers and sisters, bear thy arms and be merry<br/>To the front, to battle!<br/>Defeat is a sickness and we've found the cure</p>
