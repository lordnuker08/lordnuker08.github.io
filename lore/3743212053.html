<h2>Duty Bound</h2>
<p>
Taeko-3 was smirking again. Sloane liked a lot of things about her. The smirk wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>"Sure. A weird Hive ritual. Nothing we haven't seen before, right?"<br/><br/>Sloane gripped the railing. "Everything under those waves is something we haven't seen before." The Hunter behind Taeko rolled his eyes. The railing crunched under Sloane's hand.<br/><br/>"You worry too much, boss! We've dropped a thousand Hive with our Sparrows. When the three of us"—the Hunter flourished a blade, and the other Warlock cocked a shotgun; did they practice this?—"are working together, we're unstoppable."<br/><br/>Sloane walked forward and put her hands on Taeko's shoulders. The smirk disappeared. The Hunter's blade dropped, but he caught it out of the air.<br/><br/>"Taeko. They're not always going to have your back. What are you going to do when you're the last one standing?"<br/><br/>The smirk came back. "Easy. Embrace the Praxic Fire."</p>
