<h2>Dawnblade</h2>
<p>
A young—by Warlock standards—apprentice holds out a hand and reaches for flame. Nothing. The wizened teacher laughs. “You're supposed to be teaching me. Not laughing.” <br/><br/>The teacher's arm extends as one word hangs in the air, “Sword.” As quickly as it appeared, the blade vanishes. “That doesn't help.” <br/><br/>“Sword.” In a flash, the blade appears again, this time at the student's throat. Both pairs of eyes widened. One aghast, one aglow. “Say it with me.” <br/><br/>Two voices ring: “Sword.” <br/><br/>A blade appears in each outstretched hand. A pair of wings form on each Warlock's back. Two Warlocks take flight and vow to never again look down.</p>
