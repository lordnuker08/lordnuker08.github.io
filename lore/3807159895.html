One good shot, and everyone else would abandon this foolish crusade on this miserable planet—<br/><br/>"This is all of them? The most advanced weapons you have?"<br/><br/>Zahn tried not to lose his temper. "Would I have made the trip all the way to this 'throne room' without them?"<br/><br/>It was a lie, of course, but this puffed-up "Dominus" didn't need to know about the experimental vehicles Zahn had been working on since—<br/><br/>"Were I you, Zahn, I would think hard before giving so flippant an answer."<br/><br/>This was the "Consul" who had deposed Zahn's best customer. Zahn didn't turn around as he said, "If I were you, roach, I would think hard before wasting the time of the only real weapons supplier you've got."<br/><br/>Growls from all over the room, but Zahn smiled. They needed him. And they knew it.</p>
