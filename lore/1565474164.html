Josef opened the door. Shaxx filled the hallway beyond.<br/>"You look like hell," said the Crucible Handler.<br/>Josef scoffed. "Get out of here. I have Hive to hunt. No time for the Crucible today."<br/>"Hive. You lost her on the Moon?"<br/>Josef said nothing.<br/>"You aren't the only Guardian to leave loved ones behind on that rock." Shaxx held out a long, lacquered box. "The Gunsmith asked me to deliver this personally."<br/>"What's Banshee thinking? I can't afford this."<br/>"I took care of it. Scavenged parts from my personal collection."<br/>Josef considered it a moment.<br/>"It's a good gun."<br/>"She was a good dog. This isn't a replacement. But it will help you finish your business with the Hive. Then I expect to see you back in the Crucible. We could use the inspiration."</p>
