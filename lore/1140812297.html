[Personal notes, scored in Hive leather with a knife.]<br/><br/>Something new has blossomed in the Cradle. A gift to reward my attention. It terrifies me, and the more afraid I am, the more I want to accept it. I came to learn from what I fear most. The more I am afraid, the more there is to learn.<br/><br/>The shoot is a single silver branch, with leaves like down. I think they are tiny feathers.<br/><br/>Is it some thorn of Savath√ªn's, sent to bring disaster?<br/><br/>No. I know it is not; that would be too simple. It is from the black Pyramid. It was meant for me.<br/><br/>I will let it grow and see if it bears fruit.<br/><br/>It is true that I am watched by many Guardians, and doubted, and mocked. But this is the price of connectedness. This is proof, no matter how bitter, that I am part of something larger. Others look to me for guidance, so I choose to be worthy of that trust. I choose to tell Zavala what I have found.<br/><br/>I will even invite him to see it.</p>
