<h1>Entry 25</h1>
<div/>
<p>
Entry 25<br/><br/>We are not alone with the Traveler.<br/><br/>Something else has been detected out there. An anomaly of sorts. I'm lucky to have friends in informative places who tell me these things.<br/><br/>They don't know what it is. But there is something. Could be another Traveler. Could just be a wonky radio wave. Or could be something really bad.<br/><br/>On the off chance it IS something to be concerned about, shouldn't we be prepared to deal with it head-on before it arrives?<br/><br/>But how are we supposed to do that when the means to defend ourselves are not in the people's hands anymore? Don't get me wrong, it's not like I don't understand those decisions. They make sense, but…<br/><br/>Having a child changes your perspective on life. I won't feel comfortable unless I am the one doing something to protect my family. I can't be the only one.<br/><br/>No more sitting around thinking someone or something else will do it for us. I will handle it.<br/><br/>And I won't do it alone. I know just the right people who would appreciate the opportunity to be a part of something like this.<br/><br/>Something that the "powers that be" would never sanction. But like I've said in the past, we don't know what else is out there in the universe. What we, or our children, or our children's children might have to face one day.<br/><br/>We will be prepared.</p>
