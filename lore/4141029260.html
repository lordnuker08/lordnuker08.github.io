Mihaylova Supplemental<br/>Nicholas & Alexandra University<br/>Provost's Office<br/>Path to Ares: 65 days to launch<br/>[loud crashing noise—apparently a slamming office door]<br/><br/>Mihaylova: Have you seen my lab? What in the world is going on?<br/><br/>Provost: Have they already been in?<br/><br/>M: Who's “they”? The computers are gone. The cabinets have been emptied out.<br/><br/>P: Oh, well, this isn't how it was supposed to go. Dr. Mihaylova. Please, sit.<br/><br/>M: I will not sit! What's happening? Have I been terminated? What are you people—<br/><br/>P: For heaven's sake. No. Your equipment is safe. It's been moved. You've been chosen to design the AI for the Catamaran mission.<br/><br/>M: I'm in the middle of my research here.<br/><br/>P: Well, now you're going to continue it there. And look— you'll be a household name.<br/><br/>M: I don't have any interest in that.<br/><br/>P: Ah! But they're interested in you. Hang on.<br/><br/>M: What?<br/><br/>P: I just sent you your itinerary. You're on a flight, Dr. Mihaylova. This afternoon. You're going to meet your computers at Central Command in Florida. Look at it this way: you'll get some sun.</p>
