<h2>Assassin's Cowl</h2>
<p><pre>"There are many Hunters who are unsung heroes. Many are unnamed. Many are known only by a glint of metal half a mile away and the crack that echoes across the canyon after their enemy falls. Others are known only by a muffled cry and the flash of a knife in the dark.

"Warlocks and Titans have their orders, but that is not our way. Hunters walk apart, separate from each other as much as from other Guardians. That is our way.

"And yet we share traditions. We share stories. We share… secrets.

"Killing is a dangerous and dirty business, be it from as far as an angel's perch or as close as a lover's embrace.

"When you get close, you need something like this.

"Unsung. Unnamed. Unseen.

"Remember these words. Repeat them to whoever follows you."

—Words of an unidentified Hunter, overheard as the Assassin's Cowl was passed to another unidentified Hunter</pre></p>
