After that, Uldren and Fikrul part ways, for a time.<br/><br/>Fikrul goes to his bloody work, reshaping Fallen society the way a hammer reshapes a spider—and drawing certain useful elements to him.<br/><br/>Uldren resumes his lonely search for Mara. He remembers a time long ago—scouting with the Crows, scouting with a young Corsair who wanted nothing more than to be defined by her wrath…<br/><br/>Perhaps Petra can be saved, too.<br/><br/>He finds her in Thieves' Landing.

She cannot be saved.<br/><br/>That night, he weeps for Petra. Mara comes to him in the darkness. She has heard his sorrow. He looks up in wonder: his sister, sending her will and wisdom to watch over him. He knows then that it will be all right.</p>
