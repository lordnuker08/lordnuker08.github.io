"Commander, we have a problem."

"Go on."

"Dr. Yanoi. She's missing."

"Firewall, present location of Dr. Yanoi."

AI-COM/FRWL//ABSENT.

"Last known location of Dr. Yanoi."

AI-COM/FRWL//AIRLOCK B, SITE 4.

"Bring up the security footage of the airlock at that time."

AI-COM/FRWL//HOLOGRAM\PROFFERED

"A mining suit?"

"Firewall, do you have audio of her exit?"

AI-COM/FRWL//AUDIO\PROFFERED

"What is she singing?"

"Sounds like nonsense."

"Firewall, do you recognize that language?"

AI-COM/FRWL//NEGATIVE.

"Yanoi. She's been with us for…" 

"Six months." 

"She was working with the Acausal Control group?"

"Yes."

"Have they made any headway recently?"

"I don't know."

"I bet she does."

"You think she… what? Stole something and left? Where would she go?"

"A ship no doubt. Probably waiting for her in some crater out there. Needed the mining suit for its tank capacity."

"A ship? What are you talking about?"

"Listen. You've been with K1 since the beginning. A lot has changed since then. A small ship could easily be tucked away somewhere out there.

"Firewall, when did Dr. Yanoi leave?"

AI-COM/FRWL//TIMESTAMP\PROFFERED

"Plenty of time."

"Should we send out a search party?"

"No. We'll handle that ourselves. Before that I want to institute some new security protocols.

"Firewall, enact security plan Delta. Inform all staff of operational quarantine. No individual is to leave their station except by schedule or express permission."
