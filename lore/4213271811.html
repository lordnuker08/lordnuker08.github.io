"Does that thing fly?"<br/><br/>"Why would you ask that?"<br/><br/>"I'm telling you it looks heavy."<br/><br/>"Don't be ridiculous. It's not heavy. You have triple-redundant shielding, sure, but that's because of the power under the hood. You put in an engine powerful enough, you can make a boulder fly. But this ain't no Boulder. You'll be zipping around the enemy so fast they'll wonder if you're even there. Try it. I'm telling you."</p>
