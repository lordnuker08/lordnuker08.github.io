<h2>Solstice Gauntlets (Rekindled)</h2>
<p>
Amanda was quiet, but Zavala could still hear the anger before her voice came back over the comms. "Due respect, Commander, I ain't got time to come be your chauffeur. There are thousands of people like me stranded down there in the City."<br/><br/>"The City is lost." He hated saying it, but he knew it in his bones. "And we're all the same now, Holliday. The Light is gone. We have to regroup."<br/><br/>"You mean run." Even angrier now. It was infectious.<br/><br/>"I mean live to fight another day. We don't have the luxury of rescue flights anymore. The longer we stay here, the tighter the noose."<br/><br/>"Then go! What's stopping you? You know how to fly a ship."<br/><br/>"Not like you. You're the best pilot in the system, Amanda. And you're the only one who can keep our ships in the air once we're away from Earth."<br/><br/>"Dammit, sir, we can't just leave them here."<br/><br/>"I've already made my decision. If humanity is to survive..." He'd leave the betting to Cayde, but he knew the odds were slim. "This is the only choice we have."<br/><br/>Silence. For a few seconds this time. "All right." Her voice cracked. He understood.</p>
