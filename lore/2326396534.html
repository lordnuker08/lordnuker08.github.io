"Explain to me how it works again."<br/><br/>"It pulls small particles of your Light as you use it and loops it at increasingly higher speeds."<br/><br/>"Why would I want my Light taken away? This sounds like a terrible piece of equipment."<br/><br/>"Close your mouth and listen. It does that until you strike something—"<br/><br/>"Good, good good good. This is better. Then what?"<br/><br/>"…"<br/><br/>"Go on."<br/><br/>"Then it whips the Light particles into each other at high speeds, causing a delayed—"<br/><br/>"DELAYED?!"<br/><br/>"A DELAYED FISSION REACTION."<br/><br/>"Why is it delayed?"<br/><br/>"Let's move on."<br/><br/>"Okay… could you just sum it up for me?"<br/><br/>"Punch something and an explosion will happen where you struck."<br/><br/>"Wonderful. Won't that hurt me?"<br/><br/>"If we're lucky, I'll be able to work that into the design specs."</p>
