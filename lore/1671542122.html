<h2>The Vow</h2>
<p>
In the courtyard of the Tower, Lord Shaxx stares out at the Last City. He puts his foot up on the railing and sighs.<br/><br/>Arcite 99-40 knows Shaxx's moods, because they are his own moods. He sidles up to Shaxx and follows his gaze to the horizon.<br/><br/>"What's on your mind, boss?" he asks with the friendly rhythm of a local bartender.<br/><br/>Shaxx is quiet for a long time, but Arcite is indifferent to the passage of time. When Shaxx speaks, it is with a deep, sobering gravity.<br/><br/>"Today," he says. "I will marry them all."<br/><br/>Hours later, after Arcite has finished tying off the bouquets and gathering the doves from the mountains beyond the City, Shaxx addresses the courtyard.<br/><br/>"Guardians," he booms. "These Crimson Days are a time to renew our bonds to one another. We gather together. We remember what we owe each other. We declare our love." He holds up a bow for the crowd to see. "Bring your fiery passion to the Crucible. Prove your devotion to your Bond." He pauses. "To those of you who win this bow... I offer my hand in marriage! Take it or leave it!"<br/><br/>Arcite releases the doves. Someone screams. Doves have not been seen in the Last City for a long time.</p>
