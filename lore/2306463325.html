<h2>Symmetry Flight</h2>
<p>
I propose a simple experiment—look around. You see light. You see darkness. There could not be one without the other. They are two sides of the same coin. <br/><br/>If it is true for these Newtonian echoes, why would it not be true of the purest, paracausal forms? <br/><br/>Therefore, I conclude: the reason you persecute me is not because of the symmetry. It's because of the truth beyond this truth, the truth which you most dread: if we could destroy darkness, but we had to give up our Light to do so, how many of us would make that trade?</p>
