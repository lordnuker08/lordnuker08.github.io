"I find it odd, the cycle we are in. I have died many times. Reborn anew, the fight pulsing through my veins.<br/><br/>"The Vex, with their minds shared, must also know this sensation. Fighting to die. Dying to fight. Over and over.<br/><br/>"I wonder what they know that I do not. Do their calculations ever have them victorious in their pursuit?<br/><br/>"We share this perpetual sequence in our encounters, yet there is no common ground outside of our mutual bloodlust.<br/><br/>"I die again. The anger rises. I fight back harder, wiping out the entire squadron of their patrolling units. More arrive. I die again, ready for my resurrection."<br/><br/>â€”Saint-14</p>
