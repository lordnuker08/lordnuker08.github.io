He goes to hear the song of death.<br/>[g:02] Nothing will deter him. None of you can stop him. Not anymore.<br/>[g:03] Toland will hear the Deathsinger's melody. He will redefine death, escape the Traveler's blunt samsara.<br/>[g:04] He will sound the depths of the powers you so myopically fear.<br/>[g:05] My only regret is that I will not live to see his triumph.<br/><br/><br/>TYPE: LIVE SURVEILLANCE FEED [CONTINGENCY-LINKED]<br/>PARTIES: Two [2].
