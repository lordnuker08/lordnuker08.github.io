[g:01] This is the final transmission of Guren, Ghost of Toland whom you call the Shattered. He goes to hear the song of death.
[g:02] Nothing will deter him. None of you can stop him. Not anymore.
[g:03] Toland will hear the Deathsinger's melody. He will redefine death, escape the Traveler's blunt samsara.
[g:04] He will sound the depths of the powers you so myopically fear.
[g:05] My only regret is that I will not live to see his triumph.

[g:01] Incoming Guardians! They've broken the perimeter. Shall I engage defenses?
[t:01] No need. They have inquisitive intentions. If murder was their mission, we'd have lost our Light long ago.
[g:02] They want to know what you know.
[t:02] Yes. And I will tell them, but they will never understand. I'll greet them with a smile and welcome them in.
[t:03] I will learn how we can benefit from their ignorance.
[g:03] Yes, but don't smile.
[t:04] Why not? A smile hides the true purpose of teeth.
[g:04] Yes, but not yours.</pre></p>
