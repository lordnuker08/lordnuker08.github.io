<h2>Bond of the Cormorant Blade</h2>
<p>
A few days after the death of the Awoken Prince...<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Warlock Aunor Mahal closed the door to her office and tossed her duster onto a chair before sitting down to think. A fan spun diligently overhead. The Praxic Halls, located in the lower levels of the second Tower, were always a little warm.<br/><br/>"What's the mission?" her Ghost, Bahaghari, asked.<br/><br/>"Who said there was a mission?" Aunor replied, clasping her armored hands as she looked down at the floor. She set her jaw. The air began to smell of ozone.<br/><br/>"The Vanguard always have something to ask of you."<br/><br/>Overhead, the fan stuttered and sparked.<br/><br/>"That doesn't mean I take every job they offer." Aunor looked up, eyes blazing with Arc Light.<br/><br/>Bahaghari orbited her charge and waited.<br/><br/>"The Drifter," Aunor said, as the fan resumed spinning.<br/><br/>"Is a criminal."<br/><br/>"They've given him the keys to the City for reasons I still don't understand, and now they want the Praxic Order to handle him. As Praxic and Ikora's Hidden, of course it falls to me."<br/><br/>"And the Hero of the Red War—"<br/><br/>"—Is a dedicated Gambit enthusiast. Already compromised for this particular job. I'll reach out to our champion myself when the time comes."<br/><br/>"If you take it."<br/><br/>"If I take it. We'll need a team. And you know I prefer to work alone."<br/><br/>Bahaghari chuckled. "Now I see. I thought you were assessing the mission. You have to get over this fear of relying on others. This City wouldn't be standing if we didn't have fireteams."<br/><br/>"Ikora offered us no support. If we accept, we'll have to personally recruit, discreetly if we can. The Drifter has contacts everywhere."<br/><br/>"Will you help them?"<br/><br/>"No Praxic should be away from the sun for too long. I used to be more brown. Maybe it's time."</p>
