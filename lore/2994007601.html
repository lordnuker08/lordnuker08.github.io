<h2>Mark of Nohr</h2>
<p>
As I watch your continual triumphs, I think that perhaps YOU can take the Valus's place, Guardian. You're brave. Combat-tested. Cunning. You have all the hallmarks of a Shadow. You're ready for training.<br/><br/>If you desire true power, power beyond your Traveler's feeble Light, seek me out.<br/><br/>I will show you how to grow fat from strength.<br/><br/>—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
