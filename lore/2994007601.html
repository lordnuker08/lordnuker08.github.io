<h2>Mark of Nohr</h2>
<p><pre>As I watch your continual triumphs, I think that perhaps YOU can take the Valus's place, Guardian. You're brave. Combat-tested. Cunning. You have all the hallmarks of a Shadow. You're ready for training.

If you desire true power, power beyond your Traveler's feeble Light, seek me out.

I will show you how to grow fat from strength.

—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</pre></p>
