"Thank you, Suraya," Mrs. Hasan replies as she leans out of her shop to look up at the string of blue lanterns. "I just can't get up on those ladders anymore." She beckons. "Why don't you come in and have a hot drink? Farrah's home." She wiggles her eyebrows, still cheeky at 85. "She's still singleâ€”have I mentioned?"

"Come on," she says. "Let's walk and talk. I bet you're hungry, and I know a guy who makes some mean tamales this time of year."</pre></p>
