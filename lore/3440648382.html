<h1>Equitis Shade Cloak</h1>
</div>
<p>
The Cabal I knew commanded ships that spoke to our affluence and cultivation, forged from the crucible of war so that we might never need to fight again.<br/><br/>But what did the Red Legion deploy in place of the glossy, magnificent fleets that I remember? Warships. Carriers. Interceptor squadrons. Harvesters. The Almighty. Blunt and base tools of war, like the soldiers who use them.<br/><br/>The Cabal fleet that I remember shocked with its allure and refinement. They would never threaten. Our power was such that our threats were unspoken. And always present.<br/><br/>A Shadow of your Guardian-tribe, with your raw instincts and reflexes, would be a perfect navigator of these vessels. You'll guide them like blades past the throat of my homeworld's planetary defense force.<br/><br/>My homeworld... I can't remember its name. Perhaps I'll give it a new one.<br/><br/>â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
