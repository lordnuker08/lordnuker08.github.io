"Never been hired by a Guardian before." Errol plants his fists on his hips and surveys the dusty cloaked figure in front of him.<br/><br/>"Don't get ahead of yourself." Marin Mansanas pushes back her hood. "You haven't heard the job yet."<br/><br/>"So let me hear it."<br/><br/>"You heard of the Trinity Ghoul?"<br/><br/>"Sure. Outrider's bow. Never met her before."<br/><br/>"Yes, you have," Marin says confidently.<br/><br/>"Yeah?" Errol raises an eyebrow, then lowers it. "Ah. Who took your bow?"<br/><br/>"The Machinist."<br/><br/>"Nice knowing you."<br/><br/>"She'll never know I was there."<br/><br/>"And where would I come in?"<br/><br/>"Is it true you fought in the Hildian Campaign?"<br/><br/>"So these scars tell me."<br/><br/>"Think you still know the lay of the field?"<br/><br/>"Wish I could forget, most days."<br/><br/>"Think you could lose the Machinist in the Hildians?"<br/><br/>Errol's stomach falls. "You want me to create a distraction."<br/><br/>"Right on target."<br/><br/>Errol scratches at the blue stubble on his chin, trying to remind himself that the fear is a good sign. It means he hasn't lost himself yet. Finally, he grins.<br/><br/>"No job too tough, if the price is good."</p>
