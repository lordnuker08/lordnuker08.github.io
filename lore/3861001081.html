<h1>Roll Call</h1>
<div/>
<p>
After the Taken War, the Scorned Barons banded together in a time of weakness to become strong, to prey on anyone and anything that practiced the old Eliksni ways. They began with the one thing their people needed to survive: Ether. In a way, the Barons had become heads of a new House, priests in their own rites, and arbiters of their own trials.<br/><br/>The terror they unleashed had almost grown as powerful as any Kell. These heathens were not Eliksni; they were more "Fallen" than any of their brethren. They were everything Judgment had sought to purge before the Whirlwindâ€”and now, they sat rotting deep in the Prison of Elders. Cayde and his "Six" had done good by their word.<br/><br/>Variks's staff tapped lightly on the floorplates, and chuckling noises emanated from his throat. He hobbled past their cells as the Servitors hummed to life.<br/><br/>Feeding time.<br/><br/>He saw hatred in every cell he passed. Bathed in the light of flowing Ether, their eyes carved at his flesh, saw him docked a thousand times more.<br/><br/>Yaviks, the Rider, the Untamed. She and her crew spread terror and disease with their noxious pikes.<br/><br/>Elykris, the Machinist. She used stolen Cabal telemetry and gravity traps to sabotage vessels, relieve them of their cargo, and haul the hulks back to their own shipyard chop shops.<br/><br/>Pirrha the Blind, the Ghost of Hellrise Cavern, who haunted the Baron's territory with phantom decoys and ended all trespassers from the shadows.<br/><br/>Reksis Vahn, the Godslayer, the Hangman. He had secreted away the Ether stores of his victims and driven the Barons and their followers into a frenzy with that tainted feast.<br/><br/>Arakses, the Wit. The Traitor. The Trickster. A mastermind. A liar, thief, and backstabber.<br/><br/>Kaniks Two-Finger, the Mad Bomber. The dangers of the Reef had multiplied a hundred-fold with his mines hidden on every rock and dusty corner of the belt.<br/><br/>And the most disgusting of them all, Hiraks, the Mindbender. This one found in the Hive a way to infect the minds of the Eliksni.<br/><br/>Only one was missing.<br/><br/>Fikrul. The Heretic. The Fanatic. One Variks once dared to call friend, back when the Archon tended to Kaliks Primes. Before his betrayal. He hoped the Fanatic was dead; Cayde assured that he was. And what was Cayde-6 if not reliable?<br/><br/>Laughing, burbling to himself, Variks shut off the lights in the hallway. And the Barons were plunged once again into darkness.</p>
