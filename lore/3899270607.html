<h2>The Colony</h2>
<p>
Have you ever watched a snake kill something? It's awful. It's so awful. I watched a man die of a terciopelo bite once. Out by the northern wall. I still have nightmares about it.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's where VEIST comes from. The inspiration, I mean. Weapons with all the power of a venomous creature. Plus an onboard AI with that creature's killer instincts.<br/><br/>And now there's the Colony. A grenade launcher packed with fully mobile, AI-controlled insectoid detonators, each one designed with a taste for blood.<br/><br/>We've made some pretty messed-up stuff. You've probably seen it. You know. But we've never made anything like the Colony before.</p>
