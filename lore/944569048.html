<h2>The Black Box</h2>
<p>
I'm making significant progress with Rasputin as regards the concept of value judgments. <br/>Obviously, that's something artificial intelligence isn't set up to tackle, but we need Rasputin to be able to make that leap. <br/><br/>Here's a hypothetical: say Rasputin has to redirect a malfunctioning warsat, and there are only two paths for it to take. One will breach the hull of a one-seat planetjumper, instantly killing its pilot. The other path will disable a Venusian pleasure craft, leaving its inhabitants alive but certain to die of starvation before they can be found. <br/><br/>To my surprise, when given this problem, Rasputin actually rendered a verdict. <br/><br/>I'm not going to tell you what it is, because I want you to enjoy your next Venusian pleasure craft trip. <br/><br/><br/>Rasputin continues to develop by leaps and bounds. <br/><br/>In a trial simulation, he successfully interpreted the meaning of corrupted, borderline incomprehensible data from a damaged warsat.  This is exactly the sort of function we need him to fill. But that wasn't the amazing part. <br/><br/>The mind-blower was that without proof, evidence, or conscious reasoning, Rasputin sensed which warsat was in trouble. <br/><br/>You heard me. Rasputin has developed intuition. I wish he could celebrate with me.</p>
