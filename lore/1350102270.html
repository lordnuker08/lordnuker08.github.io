<h2>Niflheim Frost</h2>
<p>
The fire runs through your body, pumped from the furnace of your heart. Always remember: life is warmth. Here, in this desolate place, always keep the fire burning.<br/>Death is the cold spectre, its claws frozen and teeth white like a blizzard. Never forget: to live is to burn, and the inevitability of the cold comes for us all.</p>
