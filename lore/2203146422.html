"There are many Hunters who are unsung heroes. Many are unnamed. Many are known only by a glint of metal half a mile away and the crack that echoes across the canyon after their enemy falls. Others are known only by a muffled cry and the flash of a knife in the dark.<br/><br/>"Warlocks and Titans have their orders, but that is not our way. Hunters walk apart, separate from each other as much as from other Guardians. That is our way.<br/><br/>"And yet we share traditions. We share stories. We share… secrets.<br/><br/>"Killing is a dangerous and dirty business, be it from as far as an angel's perch or as close as a lover's embrace.<br/><br/>"When you get close, you need something like this.<br/><br/>"Unsung. Unnamed. Unseen.<br/><br/>"Remember these words. Repeat them to whoever follows you."<br/><br/>—Words of an unidentified Hunter, overheard as the Assassin's Cowl was passed to another unidentified Hunter</p>
