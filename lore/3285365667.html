<h2>West of Sunfall 7</h2>
<p>
Excerpt of a letter from Ikora Rey to Eris Morn:<br/><br/>Would it be terribly offensive if I said I would have happily traded places with you and gone down to the Hellmouth rather than be in the City during Osiris's banishment?<br/><br/>Well, here's what you missed. It started because of his Lost Prophecies. A misnomerâ€”the prophecies were always accessible to those who cared about them, but the Followers proclaimed them "lost" to a City that had censored all Osirian material. And even then the City didn't truly lose them, for when the Speaker ordered me to destroy Osiris's writings, I placed the documents in my private library instead. I don't believe in burning books, regardless of my opinion of the author.<br/><br/>As to why he had to write the prophecies in iambic couplets? Simple: vanity.</p>
