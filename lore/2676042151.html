<h2>Wraps of the Emperor's Minister</h2>
<p>
I think perhaps I am finally ready to forgive you. There's no point in carrying around this hate forever. I think about who you were, and who I was, and the end seems inevitable. How can I blame you for the poisonous ambition that the Consul poured into your ear? You were merely his instrument. <br/><br/>In the end, it has all been for the better, has it not? Your betrayal is the first chapter in the story of my ascension.</p>
