At their core, computers are responsive only to precise instructions from their programmers. <br/><br/>Rasputin's designers made a mistake that exasperates me. They brought in linguists and neurobiologists, then tried to convert their expertise into rules for Rasputin to follow. <br/><br/>Way to faceplant, people. No set of concrete data can ever wrangle a human language. It's not math. Language is mutable, adaptable. For every rule obeyed, there's a rule broken. <br/><br/>Babies don't learn their native tongue through rules. They learn it through exposure, absorption. And until I roll up my sleeves and get to work, Rasputin is mankind's most expensive baby. <br/><br/>So far, so good… if you set your goals realistically. Forget Rasputin for a moment; that's something I'm just not good at. If you look at me with the tiniest shred of approval, I'll kill myself to please you. <br/><br/>I have some issues. So I am going to make Rasputin a breakthrough construct. I fed him—should be "it," but I don't care—I fed him digitized copies of every major work of literature as a foundation for language use.</p>
