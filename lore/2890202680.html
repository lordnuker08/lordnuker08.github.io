<h2>Hardy's Orders</h2>
<p>
File: Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One<br/>—Supplemental—<br/>Centro Aguirre Pacifica Resort<br/>Path to Ares: 63 Days to Launch<br/>0746<br/><br/>Hardy: OK, whoever this is, you have 30 seconds. The whole point of vacationing at the bottom of the ocean is to avoid calls.<br/><br/>General Fiedler: It's Fiedler, Hardy.<br/><br/>H: Oh! Yes, sir.<br/><br/>F: It's about Moon X.<br/><br/>H: Sir?<br/><br/>F: Your friend Evie was right. It's almost impossible to track, but she has a way, and now it showed up right where she said it would: inbound to Mars. Did you copy? It's going to be on Mars. You saw what it did to Jupiter and Mercury and Venus. So, we want to send a multinational crew to intercept it.<br/><br/>H: Multinational…<br/><br/>F: You'll be the pilot of the craft.<br/><br/>H: Uh… look, I don't disagree with the idea, but Mars is 50 million km away. <br/><br/>F: Give or take, yeah. The mission will have to depart for Mars in two months. Sixty days.<br/><br/>H: Sixty days.<br/><br/>F: So enjoy your vacation and then get back here. We're building a clubhouse and a ship. We're gonna catch this sucker.</p>
