<h2>Ashen Wake</h2>
<p>
"Be patient, Ouros. It will come in time." <br/><br/>"Why does the Forge not choose me? I'm already blessed by Light. I'm here. I wish to serve." <br/><br/>"We all have our place in the world. One day, you could be our next Magistrate. The Order would look to you for guidance." <br/><br/>"Ha! As if. I don't want to be some stuffy old leader, I'd probably have to speak—" <br/><br/>"Properly? Yes, I imagine so. I can see the fire that burns within you. I'll let you in on a little secret: speaking properly isn't the same as being proper.” <br/><br/>“I don't understand." <br/><br/>"The City dwellers think us wild, untamed. They believe that theirs is the only proper society in this age. We are not savages; we follow the Light like the others. But we forge our own path. That is what it means to be a Sunbreaker." <br/><br/>"I don't care what the City dwellers think. I want to fight." <br/><br/>"Fight you shall. But a hammer takes strength to wield. Strength in body, strength in mind. You will find the Forge in time, Ouros."</p>
