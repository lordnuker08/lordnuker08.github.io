<h2>Doom Fang Pauldrons</h2>
<p>
“It was a Warlock who first worked out that the fangs could be used as some kind of conductive amplifier when specific light frequencies were run through ‘em. I don't know the science. That's not for me. I just know they work. And in battle what works is what's best. <br/><br/>“Is it weird? Yeah. Maybe. Science fangs and space magic. But I've seen enough strange out there to understand normal ain't the norm. Anyway, the Warlock called ‘em ‘Bio-Conductive Trouble Breakers'. I call ‘em ‘Doom Fangs' ‘cause of the fang, which is obvious, and then there's the doom we tend to inflict on a situation. <br/><br/>“Plus it just sounds cooler.” <br/><br/>– Unknown Titan</p>
