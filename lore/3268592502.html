"…Is it supposed to be on fire?"<br/><br/>Marcus brushed his hands off, leaving streaks of soot on his pants. "It wasn't," he admitted. "But I can't get it to stop burning."<br/><br/>Ariadne tilted her head, watching the flames. "Why's that?"<br/><br/>"The Solar energy that Ana helped integrate," he said. "It's not totally… contained. But it's stable enough to ride. I've tried it."<br/><br/>"Does the fire ever go out?"<br/><br/>"Not as far as I can tell."<br/><br/>"Huh." Ariadne crossed her arms. "Seems dangerous."<br/><br/>"Yeah. Like I said, it's stable for now, and I can ride it, but who knows how long that'll last. It could probably explode at any second."<br/><br/>They stood in silence, watching the charred Sparrow burn.<br/><br/>"Cool," Ariadne whispered.<br/><br/>Marcus grinned. "I know, right?"</p>
