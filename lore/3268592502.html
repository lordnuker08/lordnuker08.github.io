"But I can't get it to stop burning."<br/><br/>Ariadne tilted her head, watching the flames. "Why's that?"<br/><br/>"The Solar energy that Ana helped integrate," he said.

"Seems dangerous."<br/><br/>"Yeah. Like I said, it's stable for now, and I can ride it, but who knows how long that'll last. It could probably explode at any second."<br/><br/>They stood in silence, watching the charred Sparrow burn.<br/><br/>"Cool," Ariadne whispered.<br/><br/>Marcus grinned. "I know, right?"</p>
