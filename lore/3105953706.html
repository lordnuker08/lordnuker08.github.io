<h2>Holiday Cheer</h2>
<p>
"Winter's touch will soon be gone, clouds will part and light returns<br/>Darkness pales before the dawn, blinding light forever burns<br/>Dawning comes but once a year, let your voice sing out with cheer<br/>See the ground bejeweled with snow, shake the gloom out of your heart<br/>Bathed in firelight's soothing glow, cold cannot keep us apart<br/>Dawning comes but once a year, let your voice sing out with cheer<br/>Hug your family's bodies close, take their warmth and make it last<br/>Banish all your thoughts morose, cleanse your mind of visions past<br/>Dawning comes but once a year, let your voice sing out with cheer"<br/><br/>"…"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"A little creepy, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"I don't have Skorri's talent."<br/><br/>"We… should take another crack at it before they get back from the Cosmodrome."<br/><br/>"Yeah, you're probably right."</p>
