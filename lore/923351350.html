<h2>1: Burden Part I</h2>
<p>
A lone engine rails against the faux tranquility of the Dead Zone, keeping a teetering chassis of metal just within the terminator line of brimming twilight. The carrier dives through needled mountains that perforate low-hanging clouds, cutting them into sheets of stratus and vapor that slide like flattening suds across a dusk ocean. A closed-net comms line crackles.<br/><br/>Marin Oru:<br/>Most of the canopy is too thick to land. We'll be exposed in the clearing.<br/><br/>Saint-14:<br/>She will be there. Final transmission lists six refugees; peddled for Ether.<br/><br/>Geppetto:<br/>And upward of thirty Fallen.<br/><br/>Marin Oru:<br/>In that case, I'm glad we brought the machine gun.<br/><br/>Saint-14:<br/>This Warlord who deals with them… we will have to pay them a visit.<br/><br/>Marin Oru:<br/>Focus on the task at hand. Thirty seconds.<br/><br/>Geppetto:<br/>Ms. Lucine's Ghost, Ghost, reports no Pikes. However, there is a covered pit in the camp that drew curiosity. They are going radio silent.<br/><br/>Marin Oru:<br/>Something better left alone, I'm sure.<br/><br/>They plunge into shadow, between peaks, cloud-wake trails as they slow to land. The carrier whirrs and rattles. Engines cut and cool. Titan and Warlock disembark. They wait.<br/><br/>"Well done, Geppetto." Marin Uro's voice emanates from his helmet, visor stiffly fixed on the tree line.<br/><br/>Geppetto blinks code into the gloaming horizon, awaiting response. "Thank you, Brother Marin. It was my first time."<br/><br/>Marin is a statue.<br/><br/>Saint opens the carrier's cargo hold and turns to Marin. "She will be here."<br/><br/>Geppetto blinks. "No response from Ms. Lucine."<br/><br/>"All this worry—it is over nothing. Tyv will laugh with us tomorrow." Saint pats Marin's back.<br/><br/>"Tomorrow." Marin's eyes are fixed on the darkening tree line.<br/><br/>"Yes. Tomorrow. The day after, again after that, and more until a day without armor."<br/><br/>"That's a pleasant thought." Marin straightens, peering at a point in the depth.<br/><br/>A Light blinks from the tree line.<br/><br/>"Brother Saint. I have located them."</p>
