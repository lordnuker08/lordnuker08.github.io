<p><pre>SYSTEMS CHECKLIST: 
Insulated Weapons Frame: CHECK. Insulated Firing System: CHECK. Conductive Prongs: CHECK. Amplification Drivers: CHECK. Arc-core Replication Matrix: CHECK. Arc-core Chargers: CHECK. Feedback Reduction Loop: CHECK. 
Direct User Pain Blockers: UNAVAILABLE 
Ancillary operations listed under General Systems Review.

In short: This may hurt. A lot.</pre></p>
