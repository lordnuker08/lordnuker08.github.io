SYSTEMS CHECKLIST: <br/>Insulated Weapons Frame: CHECK. Insulated Firing System: CHECK. Conductive Prongs: CHECK. Amplification Drivers: CHECK. Arc-core Replication Matrix: CHECK. Arc-core Chargers: CHECK. Feedback Reduction Loop: CHECK. <br/>Direct User Pain Blockers: UNAVAILABLE <br/>Ancillary operations listed under General Systems Review. <br/>NOTE: The user must receive incoming damage to increase outgoing damage. However, the value we predict the user will receive in return for their discomfort far exceeds any momentary pain â€“ assuming, of course, the user survives the attack. <br/>In short: This may hurt. A lot.</p>
