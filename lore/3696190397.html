File: Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One<br/>Centcom Boardroom 223B<br/>A/V Monitor<br/>Path to Ares: 517 Days To Launch<br/>1843 hours<br/><br/>Director Canterbury: Can someone get the lights?<br/><br/>Hardy: Mr. Canterbury, I notice your wife was still giving a toast out there.<br/><br/>DC: Yes, I know, thank you all for breaking away from the party.<br/><br/>Evie: Now, if you'll all look at the screen.<br/><br/>General Fiedler: Can we get some introductions?<br/><br/>H: Hardy. Special Flight Services. I'm, like, never here, I don't know anybody.<br/><br/>GF: And you are?<br/><br/>E: Evie, sir, Evie Calumet.<br/><br/>DC: Evie's one of our leading theoretical physicists. She has something important to show security services.<br/><br/>H: OK.<br/><br/>E: This. This shape you see.<br/><br/>H: It was important to show me a moon?<br/><br/>E: Not a moon. The weight's wrong and anyway, it shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>H: Is that planet beside itâ€”<br/><br/>E: Jupiter. Does everybody get that? This thing just appeared in our solar system, and it's anyone's guess why.<br/><br/>GF: What are its capabilities?<br/><br/>DC: So far we don't know. Maybe it's just a roving satellite. Maybe it's something a lot scarier.</p>
