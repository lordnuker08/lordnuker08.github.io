<h2>Solstice Mark (Resplendent)</h2>
<p>
"Anokai Tai, checking in."<br/><br/>The Titan listened for a response as he throttled the Wayfarer Z over the rubble of a collapsed building and onto what had once been a busy road. He watched for activity. Nothing yet.<br/><br/>"Tai, we see you," the voice on the radio came back. "About twelve klicks to the rendezvous point."<br/><br/>The Titan accelerated, staying low. He was picking up a pair of Guardians—two more just like him who had been passing information to an offworld ship when their vehicle was destroyed. Just a few weeks ago, he would have scoffed at putting three people on a Sparrow. Now pickups like this were almost normal.<br/><br/>A large Legion ship—he didn't know what kind—lay strewn across his path. He pulled back on the stick to rise over the wreck, but something within the Sparrow sputtered.<br/><br/>A second later, that something caught fire.<br/><br/>No no—<br/><br/>The Sparrow slammed down onto the cratered road. Plasma bolts flew past Tai. Ambush.<br/><br/>Tai leapt off the Wayfarer Z and ducked behind it, firing as a platoon of Red Legion emerged from the wreck. He managed to get two before the Sparrow exploded.</p>
