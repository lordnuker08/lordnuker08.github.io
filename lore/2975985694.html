<p>
AKRAZUL'S IMPOTENT RAGE<br/><br/>"There are none.<br/>"Their strength is a shade of that required by the sword logic's demand for blood and pain.<br/>"They, as all, must be made to suffer for their worth to be evident, but they fear such ends.<br/>"I am no Inquisitor, by right or title.<br/>"Yet, I see clearly, through the sullied haze of their ambitions.<br/>"They speak of honor and nobility.<br/>"They have none.<br/>"They crave power. Not truth.<br/>"They seek evolution but cannot comprehend its price, or meaning.<br/>"They want, only because they want—these heathen 'saviors' forewarned in prophecy.<br/>"Come from the depths to feast upon those weakened by our loss and our struggle against enemies more brutal than time.<br/>"I fear the path you court, sister, is a rebuke of more than tradition.<br/>"You challenge Understandings mapped upon flesh, bone, and the very essence of centuries beyond knowing.<br/>"You seek to unmake the logic, for selfish gain.<br/>"Such is a treasonous affront.<br/>"Others have tried.<br/>"Others have been held to account for such callous sin.<br/>"Yet, I look upon the lustful offspring of our once-King, and I see cowards.<br/>"I see our end—written in greed.<br/>"The aftermath of a feeble reign.<br/>"Such is not how I would see us fall.<br/>"Ridden to oblivion by spoiled heirs and would-be heroes born of the desperate throngs who only now, after the battles have been fought and our war lost, find their courage… here in the wake of our undoing."</p>
