<h2>The Bronco</h2>
<p>
"They don't make 'em like they used to."<br/><br/>Here at Tex Mechanica, we've been saying that about guns for years. In these days of technological advancement, when everyone's gone starry-eyed over what's new and what's next, neat gadgets and slick design win out over pure firepower every time. But that ain't always how it was. And with a Tex gun, that ain't how it has to be now, either.<br/><br/>We make guns the way they're meant to be: fast, powerful, and built to last.<br/><br/>Now we're setting our sights on a new frontier. That's right—saddle up and get ready to ride, because Tex Mechanica is in the Sparrow business.<br/><br/>Designed with the true Guardian experience in mind, this beauty will let you ride hard and fast over rough terrain, laying waste to anything that dares stand in your path.<br/><br/>I may be nothin' but an old hunk of metal with a personality built around a corporate brand identity, but I tell you what… I know quality, Guardian, and quality's what you get when you go with Tex Mechanica.<br/><br/>Like we always say: If you're gonna play, play for keeps.</p>
