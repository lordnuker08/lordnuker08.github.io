<h1>Cuirass of the Emperor's Champion</h1>
</div>
<p>
I've known you through many lives now: gladiator, Primus, usurper. With each new incarnation, I think we learn a little more about each other. How many more lives before our relationship becomes complete? <br/><br/>But this life is my last, because there is no further that I can go. When next we meet, you will face one who has transcended even the gods. What will you be?</p>
