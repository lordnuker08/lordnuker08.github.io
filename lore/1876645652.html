<h2>Cuirass of the Emperor's Champion</h2>
<p><pre>I've known you through many lives now: gladiator, Primus, usurper. With each new incarnation, I think we learn a little more about each other. How many more lives before our relationship becomes complete? 

But this life is my last, because there is no further that I can go. When next we meet, you will face one who has transcended even the gods. What will you be?</pre></p>
