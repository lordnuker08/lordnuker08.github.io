<h2>Entry 123</h2>
<p>
Entry 123<br/><br/>Nostalgia overcame me today. We came upon an amusement park I used to love, back before all this.<br/><br/>But now, nature had begun to lay claim to this place. Fortunately, I could still describe most of it in detail.<br/><br/>I showed her where I liked to eat, where I rested my weary feet, and even a petting zoo, where I'd appreciated the beauty of exotic animals. I started to tell her stories about when I was here with my family… but a scratch in my throat made me stop. I suppose these wounds are still bleeding.</p>
