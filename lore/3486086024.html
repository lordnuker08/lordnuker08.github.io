Drifter found what he was looking for. Three long containers marked "Tex Mechanica."<br/><br/>He slid a long blade under each lid and cracked them open. Rifles, sidearms, andâ€¦ hand cannons. Drifter pulled a cannon out of the long box, held it up in the dim light.<br/><br/>No one made Dark Age guns anymore. Drifter had looked far and wide. The one source of Dark Age weaponry in this system was him. Gambit.<br/><br/>Dark Age weapons had been forged at a time when Light fought Light. Everything was just a little more efficient back then. And lethal. In Drifter's opinion, of course.<br/><br/>But Tex Mechanica? They came close. They made very reliable cannons. Drifter stared hard at the one he held. The stuff of legend.<br/><br/>The train car jostled, snapping him out of his daydream.<br/><br/>He took everything he could carry.</p>
