<h2>Mask of Nohr</h2>
<p><pre>Valus Nohr wore this last; she who was the greatest Phalanx of her time. On our long journey back from the deep, she fought in the campaign to bring the Clipse into my fold. In the final stretch of that war, the Clipse took her arm. She took their principal city.

â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</pre></p>
