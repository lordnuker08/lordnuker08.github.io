<h2>Shadow's Grips</h2>
<p>
You've helped me free the Crown of Sorrow from Gahlran's poor, decayed mind.<br/><br/>My jowls are shivering, and though you are not here, I bellow for you.<br/><br/>Such is my adoration for your magnificent act.<br/><br/>But now to send the Psions into the depth of the Crown. Analyze it for additional traps.<br/><br/>You've worn Hive armor before. The hides of both the Taken King and his son.<br/><br/>Those did not whisper, did not sap your will.<br/><br/>This Crown was willing to share power, where the armor of the King left nothing real behind for you to take. Because the King takes.<br/><br/>The Crown of Sorrow is more charitable. Giving. TOO giving. Because what it gives is infection. Gahlran thought he could overcome it. You saw the result.<br/><br/>I thank you for freeing him. He's in a better place now. A place we're all going, when the black edge closes in on us.<br/><br/>â€”Emperor Calus</p>
