<h2>Shadow's Greaves</h2>
<p>
We found the Crown of Sorrow on a stray war moon. The Psions guessed that the ritual texts surrounding it claimed it was crafted in imitation of the Taken King's power to compel wills.<br/><br/>It did the opposite, of course, and consumed my Loyalist Gahlran.<br/><br/>That was my first encounter with the witch. She has been plaguing all my Loyalists since then, as a sort of viral language. Perhaps even you.<br/><br/>But she can be beaten. The Hive are not true beings of the dark. Not compared to what I met at the black edge.<br/><br/>Not compared to me.<br/><br/>I shall find her and her Ascendant Plane before the end. And we will have words.<br/><br/>—Emperor Calus</p>
