<h2>Sanguine Alchemy</h2>
<p>
When you were mortal, your power lay in your blood. When you felt joy, it swelled within you. Your body and mind were clear and light.<br/><br/>When you felt passion, it coursed within you. Senses sharp. Everything crisp.<br/><br/>And when you felt anger, it felt as if the blood would overtake you. Wrest control from thought, from reason.<br/><br/>But that was early on.<br/><br/>You have learned control, in all those things. You could call on it. Your mind is strong.<br/><br/>But now a new power courses through your veins. Through flesh. Through bone. It suffuses all that you are.<br/><br/>So now, the blood calls to YOU.<br/><br/>Are you strong enough?</p>
