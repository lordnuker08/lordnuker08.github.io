<h2>Plate of Transcendence</h2>

Yardarm-4 spun, looking around the grotto.<br/><br/>"You hear that? Who is that?" Yardarm-4 had to stop himself from shouting.<br/><br/>"I hear it," Rekkana and Lisbon-13 said as one. A chill ran through him. How had they heard the voice if it was in his head?<br/><br/>All three Guardians called for their Ghosts.<br/><br/>"Ghost?" Yardarm-4 was first. "What have we got?"<br/><br/>Yardarm-4 started walking away even as his compatriots began talking with them.<br/><br/>"What are you looking for?" his Ghost asked.<br/><br/>"Anything. Everything. I… I'm not… Scan me. Look for something, someone else."<br/><br/>"Wow. OK…" His Ghost didn't understand, but it did as asked. "So, uh, what exactly am I look—?"<br/><br/>Yardarm-4 watched his Ghost's scan sputter out. Then the Ghost fell and clattered across the ground.<br/><br/>As Yardarm-4 picked it up, he felt his Light fading.<br/><br/>"Yardarm, Lisbon, you OK?" Rekkana asked from somewhere distant.<br/><br/>"Yeah. Sure." But Yardarm-4 did not feel OK, and he was not sure about anything.</p>
