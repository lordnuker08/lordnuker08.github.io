Ship's Final Log:<br/><br/>Osiris.<br/><br/>I hope whatever you find in this place is worth it. My recommendation to install you as Vanguard Commander was not a gesture to stroke your ego. It was an order to stay and help the City achieve all that it could. An order you refused to follow. News of my demise will no doubt reach you late. I can already see your response—the guilt that will follow, however fleeting. I thought you had changed after Six Fronts; that seeing your people on the brink of destruction and spared from death would be reward enough to stay. To fight. I'll fight in your stead one last time.<br/><br/>Father.<br/><br/>My duty is at its end. I've seen what the City can become. I know you can lead its people to it.<br/><br/>To my inspiration.<br/><br/>Your final gift to me I now send back to you. It will be good to see you again.<br/><br/>—Saint-14</p>
