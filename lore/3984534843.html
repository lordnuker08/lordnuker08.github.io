<h2>Cloak of the Emperor's Agent</h2>
<p>
Ghaul was a masterful conspirator. He spent his whole life dedicated to a higher purpose. Few survive the gladiator pits. Even fewer rise to the rank of Primus. It is remarkable that a discarded runt managed to do both, all the while living a double life. <br/><br/>It was only at the very end that I even began to suspect him. He possessed an absolute, single-minded dedication to his life of deceit. I see the same cunning in you, my dear Hunter.</p>
