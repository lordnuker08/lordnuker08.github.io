<h1>Eriana's Vow</h1>
</div>
<p>
Omar: This place reeks of death.<br/><br/>Toland: Worse. Rebirth.<br/><br/>Sai: Once something is gone, it should stay that way.<br/><br/>Eriana-3: I can't share that sentiment.<br/><br/>Sai: You will never find peace if you can't accept your loss.<br/><br/>Eriana-3: I'll find peace when I rip that monster's beating heart from his chest.<br/><br/>Eris: I have never known vengeance to bring peace.<br/><br/>Eriana-3: What do you think I should hope for, then? All I have left is my vengeance and my gun.<br/><br/>Eris: A Hand Cannon with a sight, yet you see nothing but rage. Don't allow it to cloud your judgement. Wei gave you the weapon for a purpose.<br/><br/>Eriana-3: Yeah, to keep me at a distance from the Hive. And now I'm heading straight toward them. Somewhere out there, she's shaking a fist at me.<br/><br/>Eris: We can honor her still by ridding the world of the disease that is Crota.<br/><br/>Eriana-3: There is no world for me after Crota.<br/><br/>Eris: What you are feeling… is to be expected. In time, we can forge a new world. Together.<br/><br/>Eriana-3: I want to believe that is possible.<br/><br/>Vell: I hate to interrupt this touching moment, but does anyone else hear that?<br/><br/>Sai: That rumble?<br/><br/>Toland: Thralls… I think they mean to welcome us.<br/><br/>Eriana-3: Let them come. I'll be the last Light they ever see.</p>
