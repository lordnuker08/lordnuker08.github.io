<h1>Vest of the Emperor's Agent</h1>
</div>
<p>
I know that you have gone to the Sol system. I'm writing because I will be there soon as well. Perhaps a reunion is in order? <br/><br/>My agents have left ahead of me to prepare for my arrival.  I like to establish good relationships with the locals. I know it may surprise you, but one of the ways in which I have grown is my attitude towards the lesser species. I've come to believe that there is a place for all creatures in my empire. The end will be so much more interesting if we face it together.</p>
