I thought the Golden Age was a time of peace."<br/><br/>::It was a time of peace.::<br/><br/>"This is a lot of firepower, Red."<br/><br/>::Swords keep peace.::<br/><br/>"And this armor—even a Guardian wouldn't turn this down."<br/><br/>::They protected me. I protected them.::<br/><br/>"The Seraphs are gone now?"<br/><br/>::Everything is gone.::<br/><br/>"So those blades you gave to the Guardians belonged to the Seraphs."<br/><br/>::Yes.::<br/><br/>"You trust them?"<br/><br/>::Everything is gone.::</p>
