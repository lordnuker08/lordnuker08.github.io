"Pike racing is a dangerous game. Especially if the weapons are hot, which I insist they are. Lots of casualties. Lots of money. I like it." The Spider examines a dense data display on the specs of the proposed race. His HUD scrolls a rapid series of calculations. "And with a Sparrow like that as the prize, there's going to be plenty of interest. Where did you get it, anyway?" <br/><br/>The Fallen gang leader shrugs his top pair of shoulders. "Guardians like to gamble. Badly." <br/><br/>"That they do," the Spider says and collapses the data display, focusing his attention on his visitor. "Of course, there will be expenses: security, clean up, bribes. It won't be cheap." <br/><br/>The Fallen thug clicks his teeth in annoyance. "You talk too much. Human talk. Name your price." <br/><br/>The Spider continues, nonplused. "First, I want a cut of every bet placed. Five percent. Next, all the scrap and corpses from the wrecks belong to me. My turf, my salvage. And finally, I need to know who's going to win the race before it starts." <br/><br/>The Fallen thug nods. "Three percent. Keep the scrap. Winner will be me. Always me." His entourage cackles in agreement. <br/><br/>The Spider holds all four of his palms outward, signaling concurrence. "Then it's a deal. Happy hunting."</p>
