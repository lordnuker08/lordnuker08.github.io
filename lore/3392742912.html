<h2>Ophidia Spathe</h2>
<p>
Hunter,<br/><br/>You are the blade. <br/>You are balance. You cut through the air with poise and grace. <br/>Your hands are quick. Your feet are light. <br/>You strike like silent lightning. <br/>Your light shines like a glistening edge in the sun. <br/><br/>You are the snake. <br/>You are level and silent. You move with purpose. <br/>Your enemies feel fear in your presence. <br/>Your fangs are sharp and quick. <br/>Your eyes are clear and your wrath is blinding. <br/><br/>You are the blade. You are the snake. <br/><br/>Strike. Shimmer. Survive.</p>
