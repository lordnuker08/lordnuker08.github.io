Yara slammed a rocket into her launcher. "These crates really skimp on quantity."<br/><br/>"Sadhij is down." Trestin turned to Yara. "This one's alone."<br/><br/>The words had barely escaped her when a Warlock brimming with Void Light Nova Warped past them. Yara turned and launched a rocket over Trestin's head. The opposing Warlock concentrated her aura of Void energy into her hand and unleashed a supernova blast. The two projectiles collided; void and flame ripped through each other and burst outward, sending all three fighters in different directions.<br/><br/>Yara groaned as her vision began to clear. Her head sang a familiar tune of disoriented pounding and Auto Rifle fire. Fresh blood ran from rigid shrapnel protruding from her leg. "Trestin… check in."<br/><br/>No answer. Yara reached blindly through dust and particulate to recover her weapon, but found only scattered bits of stone and debris.

The Warlock recoiled from the force and whipped an open palm of malformed Void at Yara, releasing unstable energy that shattered the pistol's frame into ragged scraps. "No more of that."<br/><br/>"That was cruel. She didn't deserve…"<br/><br/>"None of us 'deserve.' It's about what you can get." The Warlock smiled and raised a hand of gnarled Void. "Brace yourself."</p>
