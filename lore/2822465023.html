"He's the one," Radegast said, pleased with himself.<br/><br/>Felwinter stood in front of the Iron Lords with his Shotgun loose but ready at his side. He said nothing.<br/><br/>"All right," Efrideet said, clapping her hands together. "Well, right off the bat, you look like an Iron Lord. Formidable. Grim."<br/><br/>Lord Saladin thinned his lips but said nothing.<br/><br/>Efrideet walked in a circle around Felwinter, studying his beat-up armor. She paused behind him, and then said uneasily, "Turn around."<br/><br/>Felwinter hesitated, and then reluctantly began an awkward, stomping turn-in-place. He faced away from the Iron Lords, revealing the back of his helmet: Embedded in it was a broken, flickering Ghost. Its eye darted in frantic circles. <br/><br/>"What in the Traveler-forsaken hell is that," Skorri breathed.<br/><br/>Felwinter turned back around. "Warlord's Ghost," he said.<br/><br/>The group stood in stunned silence.<br/><br/>"OK," Efrideet said slowly, walking back over to join her companions. "First rule: No armor modifications usingâ€¦ half-dead Ghosts." She grimaced. "Take that thing off."<br/><br/>"It's useful," Felwinter said. His Ghost floated beside him and bobbed, as if to nod.<br/><br/>"I have to agree with Efrideet," Saladin said. "Put it out of its misery. You should've done that a long time ago." He eyed Felwinter. "Non-negotiable."<br/><br/>They stared at each other for a long moment, sizing each other up.<br/><br/>"All right," Felwinter said finally. "I'll take it off."<br/><br/>But he never did.</p>
