<h1>Mark of the Great Hunt</h1>

Mara stared at the Wall of Wishes. She had no more bargains to make. Her plans were in motion.<br/><br/>There was nothing left but the wait.<br/><br/>She pulled a sidearm from a hidden holster and cracked a dozen rounds into the Wall.<br/><br/>The cosmic balance shifted. Somewhere in the Dreaming City, Riven heard the Queen's wish and a thousand shrieking tears in reality cut through the space in front of her.<br/><br/>Lord Shaxx suddenly blocked Mara's view of the Wall.<br/><br/>"—YES, AND WE'D ALL BE DEAD!" He was screaming at no one, with a mug of caffeine in his fist.<br/><br/>He started, almost spilling his coffee. "Where are we?"<br/><br/>Mara slapped the mug out of his hand. It shattered on the floor. She shoved a weathered book in his face. "I told you there would come a time when I collect for the Reef Wars. Read this. Out loud."<br/><br/>"No one tells me what to do," he said, grabbing the book and incinerating it in a bolt of Striker lightning. "I can recite The Tempest by heart." And he did. Mara sat and listened. They stayed for a long time. <br/><br/>The helmet stayed on.</p>
