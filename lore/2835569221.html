<p>
Consensus Meeting 3230.01<br/>Zavala: "I call this meeting of the Consensus to order."<br/>New Monarchy: "Only the Speaker can call us to order."<br/>Cayde-6: "Oh, really? Well, guess we can't have meetings anymore. If you'll excuse meâ€”"<br/>Ikora Rey: "Sit down, Cayde. We're having this discussion, bylaws be damned."<br/>FWC: "What do the bylaws say about choosing a new Speaker?"<br/>Z: "Nothing."<br/>IR: "Then we'll write new ones."<br/>DO: "Knowing us, that's going to take time. A lot of time."<br/>Z: "In the meanwhile, we will have to move forward without a Speaker."<br/>NM: "Who will take his place? You?"<br/>Z: "None of us will take the Speaker's place. And all of us will. We must find our own consensus now."</p>
