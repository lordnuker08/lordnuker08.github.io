The Hunter pushed off the windowsill she'd been leaning on and stretched out her arm so the metal scarab on her gauntlet flashed in the sun.<br/><br/>"And here I thought I was bein' subtle."<br/><br/>The Titan's smile widened. "You know what they say about Hunters."<br/><br/>"Everything you've heard about Hunters is true. Everything."<br/><br/>As if to underscore her point, a sizzling Line Rifle bolt sizzled through the cracked window and knocked the Titan dead.<br/><br/>When he came to, the Hunter was lounging on a pile of smashed and broken Vex chassis.<br/><br/>The Titan let out a low whistle, impressed. "Mission accomplished."<br/><br/>"Hm," the Hunter agreed. "On to that other mission we were discussing."<br/><br/>"Ah," said the Titan. "And if we're, uh, both wearing beetles?"<br/><br/>It was the Hunter's turn to smile, sharp and swift as a blade. "You know what else they say about Hunters. We're good at adapting."</p>
