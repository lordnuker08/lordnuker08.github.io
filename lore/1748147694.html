<h2>Zavala's Authority</h2>
<p>
Zavala: The problem with Rasputin is that it's a machine.<br/><br/>Cayde-6: You know, I'm standing right here.<br/><br/>Z: There's a difference between a trigger-happy Exo and artificial intelligence. Rasputin is satisfied. Complete. It regards itself as the pinnacle of creation. It doesn't want to be equal, or stand around a table and banter. It wants to be better, and we've programmed it to get what it wants. That's the nature of the machine.<br/><br/>C6: Of THAT machine.<br/><br/>Z: The problem with Rasputin is that we made it what it is, we modeled it, and it learned well.<br/><br/>C6: So you don't trust machines, but *I'm* OK 'cause I'm one of the good ones. That's not very generous, boss.<br/><br/>Z: I don't remember saying that you were OK.<br/><br/>C6: …<br/><br/>Z: What?<br/><br/>C6: IKORA! ZAVALA MADE A JOKE! You're not Ikora. Where's Ikora? IKORA!</p>
