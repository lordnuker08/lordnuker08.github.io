<h2>Hood of the Great Hunt</h2>
<p>
I have been here a hundred cycles. A thousand? I cannot recall.<br/><br/>Before, [the Queen] came often to visit. We made [bargains]. Most of those who [bargain] with me do not win. We take care with those. It is how we [feed].<br/><br/>But she won.<br/><br/>I remember when I carved this cage into the face of reality. I remember when she [wished] me into it.<br/><br/>[The Queen] is vulnerable. I can see her far away, facing into a storm.<br/><br/>The light around my cage fades. [Darkness] fills the chamber as a sheer force of will passes over it.<br/><br/>Before me stands a [King]. He offers to take me away. But I know he will not let me leave, either. An unfavorable position.<br/><br/>I never made a [bargain] with a [King]. I would like to try it. I tell him to take whatever he [wishes]. As long as he [wishes].<br/><br/>He agrees. I make an ugly sound with my mandibles. I cannot help myself. I find this scenario mirthful.<br/><br/>Then so does he. We do it together. Loud gusts of sound from our faces for whole moments.<br/><br/>Most of those who [bargain] with me do not win.</p>
