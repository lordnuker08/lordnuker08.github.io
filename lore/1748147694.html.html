<h2>Zavala's Authority</h2>
<p><pre>Zavala: The problem with Rasputin is that it's a machine.

Cayde-6: You know, I'm standing right here.

Z: There's a difference between a trigger-happy Exo and artificial intelligence. Rasputin is satisfied. Complete. It regards itself as the pinnacle of creation. It doesn't want to be equal, or stand around a table and banter. It wants to be better, and we've programmed it to get what it wants. That's the nature of the machine.

C6: Of THAT machine.

Z: The problem with Rasputin is that we made it what it is, we modeled it, and it learned well.

C6: So you don't trust machines, but *I'm* OK 'cause I'm one of the good ones. That's not very generous, boss.

Z: I don't remember saying that you were OK.

C6: …

Z: What?

C6: IKORA! ZAVALA MADE A JOKE! You're not Ikora. Where's Ikora? IKORA!</pre></p>
