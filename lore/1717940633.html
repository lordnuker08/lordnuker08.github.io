"What is the Darkness?"<br/><br/>You open your eyes and gaze at your cloak, seeking an answer to your question.<br/><br/>It billows around you furiously, buffeted by roaring wind in a world full of L I G H T.<br/><br/>You see your Ghost clinging to it for dear life with bits of his shell.<br/><br/>"I thought you would never look back here!" Ghost shouts into your mind. "I've launched a battery of spectral scans off our position—what we're experiencing is real!"<br/><br/>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE REAL<br/><br/>"Or as close to real as these… beings can conjure!"<br/><br/>THAT WORD DOES NOT DESCRIBE US WELL. WE ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND LESS.<br/><br/>"The armor you found in ontological space—it's giving off the same energy signature I picked up when you asked the Nine about the nature of the Dark!"<br/><br/>Your Ghost grips tighter as the wind whips your cloak, rippling it like a kite.<br/><br/>"I think that question produced an ontological effect—one that hasn't fully resolved!"<br/><br/>THE LIGHT DESTROYS. GUARDIANS DESTROY. BUT GHOSTS REBUILD. THEY ARE A TANGENTIAL EXPRESSION WITHIN THE COMMON EQUATION.<br/><br/>"They're still trying to answer the question!"<br/><br/>A harsh glare blooms from the heavens above.<br/><br/>Something grips your hands, desperately shaking them.<br/><br/>Your soul is weary.<br/><br/>Your feet find purchase in shifting sands.</p>
