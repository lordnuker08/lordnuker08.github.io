<h2>BrayTech Sn0Helm</h2>
<p>
"Our scouts have had a problem with their helmets fogging up. There's nothing worse than trying to scan a unique mineral deposit out in a storm and getting a face full of fog. With the new sn0helms we've installed thermal piping and a bunch of moisture regulators—this way, we'll always be able to keep cool heads in the field. Just not literally."<br/><br/>—Fabrication Engineer, BrayTech R&D</p>
