<h2>Opulent Stalker Cloak</h2>
<p>
MCXX-II, forthcoming.<br/>Recorded by Underscribe Shipal<br/><br/>Thus did the Shadow of Earth slay the Titan Vanguard Zavala.<br/><br/>As recorded by the enshrined Scribe Shagac, the Vanguard of Earth requested mercy, and their request was denied. Thus the Titan Zavala was permitted a final day to consider his perfidy before his death.<br/><br/>So the Titan Zavala went to the Human known as Suraya Hawthorne and said, "Suraya Hawthorne, will you play a game of checkers with me?"<br/><br/>Suraya Hawthorne agreed, and so the two played twenty-seven games of checkers, and listened to the music of bagpipes and synthesizers, and dined upon Earth delicacies such as nuggets of chicken and the beer of roots.<br/><br/> "Titan Zavala," said Suraya Hawthorne as Earth's sun rose upon their latitude, "There will never again be a checkersmaster of your like."<br/><br/>"No, Suraya," said Titan Zavala. "You must become a greater checkersmaster than even me, if you are to lead the resistance."<br/><br/>Thus the Titan Vanguard did not meet his final death alone. And Suraya Hawthorne was slain at a later date.<br/><br/><br/><br/>^ Note to Underscribe Shipal: Very good. This is entirely credible.</p>
