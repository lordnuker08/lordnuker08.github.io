I push into my ossific den and he is there.<br/><br/>I see him looking over the side, toward his Traveler, head bent. He is speaking softly, but I can hear him. Anyone who was listening could.<br/><br/>He waits for a response and I do as well, tense, curious. He stands attentively, this loyal dog of a man. It is no time at all for me, but for him, the hours creep by in silence.<br/><br/>I am ready to choke the voice of his Traveler if it answers him, but there is nothing. He tightens his grip on the railing.<br/><br/>I feel something shift inside him and a new possibility presents itself.<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>Again, I press against the sockets. The net creaks softly with my eagerness.<br/><br/>Someone approaches and he turns his back to his Traveler. There is an exchange, obscured by the rubicund thrash. <br/><br/>He is given reports. Hope bleeds from him. He gives the messenger a token of his faith. They accept it without understanding its meaning.<br/><br/>He watches as they leave. There is a hollow place in his center. It is beautiful.<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>I return warily.<br/><br/>I do not see him, but I hear him. He speaks to all with a voice thick with grief. <br/><br/>I must learn how far I have been set back. I reach to him tentatively. Strength. I pushâ€”and feel only sweet, soft rot. <br/><br/>I am delirious with pleasure. It gave them no answers; it was a reflex, the spasm of dumb muscle.<br/><br/>A song of joy rises within me. <br/><br/>Now.</p>
