<h2>Robes of the Emperor's Minister</h2>
<p><pre>I think it is only fair to warn youâ€”I mean to reincorporate the Red Legion. I am their rightful emperor, and I shall offer them forgiveness. All they must do is repent and submit to their reeducation. 

I feel like it's only fair to make you the same offer. How does "Primus of the Red Legion" sound?</pre></p>
