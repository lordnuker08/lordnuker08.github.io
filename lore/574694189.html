"Marcus, these are incredible!"<br/>"What did I tell you? I call these bad boys the Fr0st-EE5."<br/>"Um, come again?"<br/>"Just call them the Frosties."<br/>"Whatever they're called, I love them. It felt like my entire body became supercharged while running."<br/>"Glad you like them. I still have a couple of kinks to work out, but when that's over…"<br/>"A couple of kinks?"<br/>"Well sometimes—and I mean very rarely—the Energy Transfer Capacitors can overheat and explode during the user's sprint. That only happens 2% of the time or something."<br/>"Wait, you sent me on that field test knowing this?"<br/>"I don't see the issue here."<br/>"I'm telling Sloane."<br/> "Whoa, Boaz, let's not get hasty. I'll make it up to you with some sparrow mods."<br/>"You can't buy me off— Wait, which mods are we talking about here?"</p>
