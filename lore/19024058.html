<p>

It's an Ionian crystal which bears some resemblance to rudimentary perovskite, which is, as you should know, a crystal with unique photovoltaic properties—<br/><br/>Photovoltaic? It means "regarding the conversion of light into electricity."<br/><br/>No, no, the gun doesn't create electricity; the gun induces an external combustion reaction. It's perovskite that—<br/><br/>I just explained the perovskite! If you'd stop interrupting—<br/><br/>Wait. I remember you. You're one of Cayde's Hunters! Get out of here! Shoo!
