<h2>Gloves of the Great Hunt</h2>
<p>
I am a [King] no longer. The [King's] corpse hangs in orbit above a world I will never see. Not from this cage.<br/><br/>I am [Riven].<br/><br/>I am [Taken], and I am beholden to no one. Nothing.<br/><br/>I have not spoken in years. I think about what inflection I would use if I did. But no one is there. The [King's] voice faded long ago. No voice comes to mind.<br/><br/>The [King] despaired in his final moments. Rightly so. His vengeance denied.<br/><br/>Most of those who [bargain] with me do not win.<br/><br/>I am afflicted by tedious repetition.</p>
