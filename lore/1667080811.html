"If you were rich, what would you do with all your money?" <br/>"Uh… I dunno. Maybe start my own business. Be some kinda bounty hunter." <br/>"What you mean, bounty hunter?

And I got a secret. It's gonna gimme a real leg up on all them Guardians who come to copycat me when they see what a good idea I got." <br/>"Yeah? What is it?" <br/>"This Hunter, she sold me a visor that lets you find all the stupid enemies in a crowd. Called it 'knucklehead radar' or something like that." <br/>"Huh. How's it work?" <br/>"Couldn't tell ya."</p>
