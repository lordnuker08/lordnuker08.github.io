<h2>Vanguard Armor</h2>
<p>
The bar's still missing its roof, and the air smells like rain. <br/><br/>Cayde-6 sits in the bar with his chair tipped, holding a shot of something acid green. He looks at you, counts the beads of sweat on Zavala's mug, and sighs. “Are we doing this, or what? C'mon, I'm rusting.” <br/><br/>Zavala straightens and clears his throat. “The Vanguard will continue until we are no longer needed, but I can foresee the day when you will...” He pauses, searching your face. <br/><br/>The moment drags. Cayde juts his chin forward. Ikora hides a smile, then lifts her glass to you. “When you will surpass us.” <br/><br/>“Wait, what?” Cayde's chair drops heavily. He leans forward. “‘Surpass' us? I didn't agree to that! This is a ‘great job being a hero' party, not a ‘Cayde is second-best' party.” <br/><br/>Ikora winks at you. “It's always been a ‘Cayde is second-best' party.”</p>
