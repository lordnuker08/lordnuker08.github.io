<h2>Hardy's Journey</h2>
<p>
File: Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One<br/>—Supplemental—<br/>Centcom Cantina<br/>A/V Monitor<br/>Path to Ares: 480 Days to Launch<br/>1149 hours<br/><br/>Evie: Jacob. You got a minute?<br/><br/>Hardy: A minute. But then I gotta go. There's a thing in Belarus; I should be back Monday.<br/><br/>E: If you're in a hurry, can I have your brownie?<br/><br/>H: You can have half. What did you want to show me?<br/><br/>E: Moon X is back.<br/><br/>H: Oh, boy. We saw what it did to Jupiter.<br/><br/>E: Or "with." You could think of it as "with Jupiter."<br/><br/>H: Whatever, the thing made some major changes to two of Jupiter's moons.<br/><br/>E: Yep, then it blinks out. Gone fourteen months. Then Mercury. And then blink, out. Seven months.<br/><br/>H: And you can't track it.<br/><br/>E: Oh, I think I might have a way. But right now that doesn't matter because guess what just showed up hanging out next to Venus.<br/><br/>H: You're kidding.<br/><br/>E: I wish.<br/><br/>H: Let me see that. What's it gonna do there?<br/><br/>E: I don't know. Magic, I guess. You know what really worries me? Next time it blinks out?<br/><br/>H: Where does it go?<br/><br/>E: Where does it go.<br/><br/>H: You can have the rest of my brownie.</p>
