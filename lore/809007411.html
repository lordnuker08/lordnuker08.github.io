To know the unknowable, the origin of all things. <br/><br/>The worms turned, rejecting the disowned son. All but one. <br/><br/>"In you, I see myself." <br/><br/>Xol, the Will of the Thousands. Lesser than his kin, but full of dark wisdom. <br/><br/>"You seek power? I will give you power beyond measure. The power of life renewed." <br/><br/>The glow of soulfire in his eyes, Nokris bowed before the worm. In his fire, he felt embrace. He felt home. <br/><br/>"Do you pledge yourself to me? Will you accept my unholy power?" <br/><br/>Nokris nodded and smiled. <br/><br/>He replied, "Yes, my lord. And together, we will take the stars." <br/><br/>Xol was pleased.</p>
