<h2>Bond of the Emperor's Minister</h2>
<p>
Ghaul once served at my right hand. His even temper and disciplined mind proved a useful foil to my passion and force of will. And so, I leaned on him for all of my important decisions. It always felt good to talk through my ideas. He had a way of reflecting them back to me sharper and clearer. <br/><br/>I see the same wisdom in you, my dear Warlock. Perhaps—when the time is right—we might discuss my ideas.</p>
