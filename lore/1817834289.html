<h2>Entries 67, 68</h2>
<p>
Entry 67<br/><br/>The Traveler is on the move. And they say it's coming here. To earth.<br/><br/>I didn't take the news of Titan's evacuation seriously enough. I should have. I should have listened to Helga and Yuki.<br/><br/>This is bigger than just me. It's about all of us.<br/><br/>If Project Niobe can help Humanity, then it's our duty to press forward with it.<br/><br/>Even if it means working closely with some unsavory types… sometimes that's the cost of protection.<br/><br/>It's only a matter of time now.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Entry 68<br/><br/>They are here. They are real.<br/><br/>I can't believe we were so… right.<br/><br/>…and so wrong. To think that we could stop this. To say we were naïve would be an understatement.<br/><br/>We simply didn't know. Their power. Their strength.<br/><br/>It's insurmountable.<br/><br/>As they draw closer, all we can do is hide and hope that the facility doors will be strong enough. It's utter chaos out there.<br/><br/>Too many put their faith in the Traveler. I don't know what sort of answers people expect from a gigantic ball in the sky. It remains silent, as always.<br/><br/>At least I'm with her. Being with family is what matters in the end.<br/><br/>There is no more hope.<br/><br/>Only the screams of humanity.</p>
