“Marcus, what—” <br/>“You're here! Finally! Get over here and hold this gun—” <br/>“Right down to business, huh?” <br/>“I will put these legs on—” <br/>“What are these? Frosties 2.0?” <br/>“No! They're completely different.”  <br/>“Uh-huh.” <br/>“OK, they share some similarities. But these are the Stompies. I'm going to do a test-drive, and if they rip my legs off—” <br/>“Is that likely?” <br/>“You disintegrate me quick before the rogue mechasynapses spread—” <br/>“WHAT—” <br/>“Boaz, please. I thought you wanted to help?” <br/>“But shooting you? And I don't even get Crucible glory for it?” <br/>“I'll let you win the next race.” <br/>“Cute.” <br/>“C'mon. If you won't do it, I'll ask Ariadne. She'd love to shoot me.”  <br/>“Fine. Gimme the gun.” <br/>“Thank you! Stompies Field Test One is go.” <br/>“I might actually enjoy this.” <br/>“That's the spirit.”</p>
