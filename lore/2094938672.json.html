<h2>Adjudicator</h2>
<p><pre>You sought us out in the deep black. 
meditation wasn't enough for you 
GO AND TOUCH THE HISSING SILENCE 
Do not fear being submerged. 
Not many ships go that far, these days. 
you went through hell to get one, and then again to get out there 
YOU FOUND THE DEVIL HIMSELF. 
A G O L D E N S N A K E A D E V I L W H O P O S E S A S G O D 
No more a god than you. 
YOU DIDN'T FIGHT HIM. 
Y O U T U R N E D A R O U N D S M A R T 
Others did. 
while we watched</pre></p>
