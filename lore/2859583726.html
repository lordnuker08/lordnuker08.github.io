<h2>Reverie Dawn Tabard</h2>
<p>
She feels Oryx's true death in both halves of her soul, a full imagined exhale before the aftershock reaches his throne world.<br/><br/>It crumbles around her like stone, like ash, like veils in a breeze.<br/><br/>Eris Morn's friends have succeeded. The Guardians have slain a god.<br/><br/>She steps through the ruins. In the end, there is nothing. Nothing but Mara Sov and the howling of rampant, untamed logics.<br/><br/>Her great and terrible gamble has paid off.<br/><br/>The rest is up to her now.</p>
