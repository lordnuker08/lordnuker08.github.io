<h2>Graviton Forfeit</h2>
<p>
Just sit down and think about what you're doing.<br/><br/>A big white ball rebuilt you from nothing. Guided your civilization. Transformed you. Didn't tell you why, did it? Doubt it mentioned the omnipotent space anathema that's coming to kill you and your dog and your whole soccer club, either, but what's a little xenocide between friends?<br/><br/>Maybe you don't care. A gun never stops and wonders if things are more complicated. It just shoots.<br/><br/>It's also possible that I'm just trying to get inside your head. You're a hero with a cape and a gun and a bike. You're gonna live forever. Who's got time for doubt? Fight the "Darkness"! Yeah!<br/><br/>You know what I'd call "dark," in the sense of "grim," in the sense of "cosmically upsetting"? A universe full of weaponized puppets, enacting a genocidal war against the servants of a rival god.<br/><br/>Is this making you uncomfortable? I'm sorry. I'll be more evil. Boo. Grrr.</p>
