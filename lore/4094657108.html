Mara knew she had been a fool to pretend to be a peer to the others. What was true of her brother was true of all Awoken. They needed secrets to marvel at, secrets that rhymed with the deep enigma of their souls. They could not follow what they fully understood.<br/><br/>There would be a formal coronation later, in a place not yet built.

We are no longer in the realm of pure science. We require an order of mysteries and witches to tend to them."</p>
