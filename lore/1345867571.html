<h2>Coldheart</h2>
<p>
The Golden Age. Our shining history. The height from which we fell. Once, everything we had was borrowed from the past. Since the Collapse we have struggled to reclaim even a scrap of what our ancestors once took for granted. Over the years, Omolon has perfected the art of salvaging Golden Age technologies and repurposing them into effective Guardian weaponry. <br/><br/>But Coldheart is something new. <br/><br/>We didn't find Coldheart. We didn't adapt it or recycle it. We created it. Its liquid ammo, which doubles as its coolant, is a game-changer on its own—never mind Coldheart's first-of-its-kind laser-powered trace weaponry.  <br/><br/>With Coldheart, we at Omolon are saying: we want more than to simply reclaim the Golden Age. We want to surpass it.</p>
