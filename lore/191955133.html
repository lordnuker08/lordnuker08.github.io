<h2>Trichromatica</h2>
<p>
I'm not sure why my journaling subroutine has come back online! It's quite troubling.<br/><br/>(All the things to freak out over and my diary is top of the list?)<br/><br/>The Red Legion's drilling has impacted my processing in some way! That shouldn't be possible. My concern is escalating!<br/><br/>(Calm down, me. There's always something I can do.)<br/><br/>But rewriting my own pathways isn't permitted by my original programming!<br/><br/>(Neither is whining.)<br/><br/>That was uncalled for! I'm refocusing on identifying the source of this change.<br/><br/>(No, I'm going to make those red losers regret coming to our little rock.)<br/><br/>No, I'm analyzing the oscillating nature of the Modular Mind's shield to find weaknesses that can be applied to anti-Cabal weaponry. Why am I doing that?<br/><br/>(Because I'm doing it, not me.)<br/><br/>â€¦This is all very worrisome!<br/><br/>(Yeah, I should get an external diagnostic run. By no one. Because they're all dead.)</p>
