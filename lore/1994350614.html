"So your name is 'Failsafe'?"<br/><br/>"Yes! And your name is the Cayde unit!" ("You're an Exo. Human brain in a robot body. Weird mouth lights.")<br/><br/>"Wait, who was that?"<br/><br/>"Who was who? I am me!"<br/><br/>"It doesn't matter. You don't know what'll happen if I do this. You're an AI, just like one back home that told me about this place."<br/><br/>"That is incorrect!" ("I'm about a thousand times smarter.")<br/><br/>"If you're so smart, how come you crashed your big ship into a horse moon?"<br/><br/>"That is very rude!"<br/><br/>"Look, we don't have a lot of time. I'm just gonna wire up this Vex teleporter to my triple jump circuits. What's the worst that could happen?"<br/><br/>"Based on my cycles analyzing Vex portal technology, one of the many alarming yet likely outcomes is that your body and consciousness are separated into two distinct antimatter dimensions!"<br/><br/>"Ah, you're making that up. Here goes."<br/><br/>"Please wait a moment, Cayde unit! I have not encountered anyone else on 7066 Nessus since the crash of the Exodus Black." ("I'm not good at being lonely.") "If you are absorbed into a quasi-space pseudorealm—"<br/><br/>"Sorry, Failsafe, gotta be brave here."<br/><br/>Dzzt.</p>
