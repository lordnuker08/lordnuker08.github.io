IV:<br/><br/>Spider's operative within Dead Orbit is a man named Howe who sounds truly terrified to receive a direct call from his covert employer.<br/><br/>Spider buries his real desire within a long list of weapons and ammunition, but Howe still manages to single it out.<br/><br/>"Did you say number eighty-nine on manifesto Dove 15?"<br/><br/>"I do not believe I stuttered."<br/><br/>"But that's… it's so old. Pre-Golden Age, we think. Linde's best guess is that it was part of a moving art exhibit."<br/><br/>"You tell me nothing I do not already know."<br/><br/>"But… why do you want it?"<br/><br/>Spider might have let the man live, up until now.<br/><br/>A pity, really.<br/><br/>"All you need to know is how much I will pay you if you bring it to me."<br/><br/>"All right," Howe says dubiously. "Give me a hundred hours."<br/><br/>"You have forty."<br/><br/>Spider ends the call, and begins the process of wiping it from the records.</p>
