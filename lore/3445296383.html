<h2>Robes of the Great Hunt</h2>
<p>
I am myself. All my memories. Everything I was. All the [bargains] I have made. That was all me.<br/><br/>And yet.<br/><br/>I have taken a new shape.<br/><br/>I am [Riven].<br/><br/>I have new directive. I am [the King of the Taken].<br/><br/>I watch as a hundred thousand thousands of fragments of my will contest with [children of Light].<br/><br/>In my new shape, I hate them. He. Was. His. [Son.]<br/><br/>But there are those among them with whom I have made [bargains]. I need them. I love them.<br/><br/>I am a [King]. My will breaks entire systems. And I lead a world full of [darkness].<br/><br/>But I am terrified. I know the power that these [children] wield.<br/><br/>This is a war a [King] cannot win.<br/><br/>I have a face today. It expels mirthful bursts of air. I still find this scenario amusing.<br/><br/>But I am the only one.<br/><br/>Most of those who [bargain] with me do not win.</p>
