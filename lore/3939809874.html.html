<h2>Plate of Transcendence</h2>
<p><pre>Yardarm-4 spun, looking around the grotto.

"You hear that? Who is that?" Yardarm-4 had to stop himself from shouting.

"I hear it," Rekkana and Lisbon-13 said as one. A chill ran through him. How had they heard the voice if it was in his head?

All three Guardians called for their Ghosts.

"Ghost?" Yardarm-4 was first. "What have we got?"

Yardarm-4 started walking away even as his compatriots began talking with them.

"What are you looking for?" his Ghost asked.

"Anything. Everything. I… I'm not… Scan me. Look for something, someone else."

"Wow. OK…" His Ghost didn't understand, but it did as asked. "So, uh, what exactly am I look—?"

Yardarm-4 watched his Ghost's scan sputter out. Then the Ghost fell and clattered across the ground.

As Yardarm-4 picked it up, he felt his Light fading.

"Yardarm, Lisbon, you OK?" Rekkana asked from somewhere distant.

"Yeah. Sure." But Yardarm-4 did not feel OK, and he was not sure about anything.</pre></p>
