<h2>Grips of the Great Hunt</h2>
<p>
Venus. A year into the Great Hunt.<br/><br/>Eris and Zavala watched as Shaxx sat with the dying Ahamkara, a hand on its snout.<br/><br/>"Is he gloating?" she asked.<br/><br/>"I think he is too pragmatic to gloat." Zavala said.<br/><br/>"Mourning, then."<br/><br/>"Perhaps."<br/><br/>The Ahamkara twitched, its eyes rolled up into its head. The biochemical glow just beneath its skin grew harsh. Zavala and Eris raised their hands against the increasing glare.<br/><br/>Then the corpse exploded. Dirt showered the Guardians like dusty rain on a clear day.<br/><br/>Shaxx sat silently in the resulting crater, covered in a sheet of green fire.<br/><br/>Zavala and Eris opened their mouths to speak, but Shaxx interrupted them.<br/><br/>"Shh," he said, as the flame quietly roared.<br/><br/>They could all hear a disembodied whisper. But they were used to that by now.</p>
