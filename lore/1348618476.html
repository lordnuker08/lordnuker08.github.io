Two Legionaries flanking a Goliath tank waddle past his hiding spot. No need to be a hero, he thinks. At least, not a dead one. Not yet.<br/><br/>"Three more blocks and we're in business. You sure you can still access the terminals?"<br/><br/>No response.<br/><br/>"You're right, I shouldn't doubt you.
