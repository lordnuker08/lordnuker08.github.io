"I'm not going."<br/><br/>Hallam let his Paladin-straight posture relax a little. "The Regent-Commander should probably attend the late prince's memorial. The Crows will want to see you. I hear they've commissioned a sword in his honor."<br/><br/>"If I go, it's as good as saying he's dead. As good as saying Mara's dead."<br/><br/>"Well," Hallam exhaled. "Aren't they?"<br/><br/>Petra ground her teeth. Then: "But I want people to believe."</p>
