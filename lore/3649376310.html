<h2>14: Patron</h2>
<p>
Stone-laid roads lead Saint-14 through the City. He walks them most days when he is home. When time permits.<br/><br/>The people wave. They cheer.<br/><br/>They bring offerings of their support and adoration.<br/><br/>Breads. Tokens. Wonderfully spun tassels and bands of royal purple hue.<br/><br/>His name had become synonymous with the Guardians.<br/><br/>An image to be adhered to; to be revered.<br/><br/>He smiles and shakes their hands.<br/><br/>He smiles and accepts their gifts.<br/><br/>Their joy is his.<br/><br/>He feels the weight of their royal ribbons around his neck, drawn tight by expectation.<br/><br/>His armor is faith. It slips and loosens in transit.<br/><br/>They sing together. He shares bread with the chorus of voices. He ties ribbons in their hair.<br/><br/>His joy is theirs.<br/><br/>They sing him a new song.<br/><br/>Their voices shine bright.</p>
