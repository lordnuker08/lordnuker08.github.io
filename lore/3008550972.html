<h2>The Stag</h2>
<p>
In a distant life I knew fear. But bones cannot bleed. Your slings and arrows carve runes of power into my skull. I am prey no longer.<br/><br/>I was your sacrifice. Your food, your harvest. You thought I would lie where I fell. But I am prey no longer.<br/><br/>Now it is my turn to stalk you among the long shadows. To make your strength my own. To take all you hold dear.<br/><br/>For I am prey no longer.</p>
