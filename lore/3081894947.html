<p>
PRAISE FOR IKORA REY'S "ON CIRCLES: REVISED EDITION":<br/><br/>"In volume after volume, Ikora Rey pioneers devastating new ways for Warlocks to destroy our enemies." —Vanguard Commander Zavala<br/><br/>"A monumental scholarly achievement that deserves a place in any serious library." —Tyra Karn<br/><br/>"An inspiring work that challenges conventions of metaphysics and ontology through the prism of a deceptively simple shape: the circle. Impressive!" —Lord Shaxx<br/><br/>"Despite a lack of rigorous data analysis and an overreliance on the mystical, this book has merits that even I must acknowledge." —Asher Mir<br/><br/>"Based on the couple of pages I got through, this is one of Ikora's most well-rounded works yet, although she makes kind of a circular argument. Also, the paper's really high quality. Very soft and smooth." —Cayde-6</p>
