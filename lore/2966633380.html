"What is the Darkness?"<br/><br/>You open your eyes and gaze at the bond on your arm, seeking an answer to your question.<br/><br/>You see a world in the space B E T W E E N.<br/><br/>WE'VE LEARNED THIS BOND AND SIMILAR DEVICES ARE YOUR FOCUS. MEDIUMS TO CHANNEL YOUR light. USELESS HERE, WHERE light AND dark HAVE NO PLACE.<br/><br/>You've built so many monuments, large and small, in worship of your Light.<br/><br/>Will you do the same for the Dark?<br/><br/>Will you ever build for yourselves again?<br/><br/>YOUR QUESTION BEGS QUESTIONS FROM US.<br/><br/>The heavens above you are clear of stars and shadows.<br/><br/>Your hands are bound in red ribbons.<br/><br/>Your soul is weary.<br/><br/>Your feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.</p>
