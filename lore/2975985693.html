AZAVATH'S EAGER EMBRACE<br/><br/>"You, of us all, have suffered and survived, brother.<br/>"To many, your severing is a mark of shame.<br/>"To many, you should have fallen to dust before returning to the depths in defeat.<br/>"My ire, as echoed by my Song, would challenge these claims.<br/>"Those who demean you…<br/>"Akrazul, the Severed Knight.<br/>"Akrazul, the Shamed.<br/>"The Weak.<br/>"The Undone.<br/>"They are one and the same with those who never dared face the undying Light.<br/>"They are the enemies of our promised morrow.<br/>"Those who watched from the shadows while your bone shattered and your limb was cast into the hollowed dark beneath this Moon's scarred surface.<br/>"I too see the sin in our dear sister's words.<br/>"More so in her intention.<br/>"But I also see a pride in all we were meant to be—all we were promised.<br/>"Why, then, give thanks to 'heirs' come to offer salvation, when such a gift is beyond their giving?<br/>"I am with you, dear sister.<br/>"I am with you, dear brother.<br/>"Let us each suffer to ensure the path—till dust or ash or Gods standing high upon eternity, burdened by our sacrifice.<br/>"For are we not worthy?<br/>"If not by ancestral right, then as those wretched few who would never seek power, but to keep its disease from the hands of the corrupt?"</p>
