He drifted in and out of… something, and saw a ship hanging from guidewires in a Cosmodrome warehouse. Fields of flowers amid alien canals, stretching to the horizon.

He realized he was muttering. "I have to find… my Guardian."

Where had he said that before? His own voice answered him. Confident, and in control. "We don't know what they look like. Not on the outside, anyway."

Drift. A masked woman with black tears streaming down her face.

"Everything we've seen."

Drift. Red braids of nanotechnology around the throats of angry scavengers.

"Everything we've done."

"I made the right choice."

Ghost opened his shell to cast back the darkness. He was alone.

And in the night beyond, the rain came down.</pre></p>
