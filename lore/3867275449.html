<h2>The Right Choice</h2>
<p>
The Light was gone.<br/><br/>He drifted in and out of… something, and saw a ship hanging from guidewires in a Cosmodrome warehouse. Fields of flowers amid alien canals, stretching to the horizon.<br/><br/>He realized he was muttering. "I have to find… my Guardian."<br/><br/>Where had he said that before? His own voice answered him. Confident, and in control. "We don't know what they look like. Not on the outside, anyway."<br/><br/>He was beneath a bridge now, somehow. Cabal searchlights lit the puddles on either side. He didn't want to look at what was under the surface.<br/><br/>"On the inside. I'd always known who you were." He blinked. He wished he could cry. "Together, we could be something… more." It started raining again.<br/><br/>Drift. A masked woman with black tears streaming down her face.<br/><br/>"Everything we've seen."<br/><br/>Drift. Red braids of nanotechnology around the throats of angry scavengers.<br/><br/>"Everything we've done."<br/><br/>The Cabal continued their grim work, and the last safe place on Earth cracked beneath their booted heels.<br/><br/>"I made the right choice."<br/><br/>Ghost opened his shell to cast back the darkness. He was alone.<br/><br/>And in the night beyond, the rain came down.</p>
