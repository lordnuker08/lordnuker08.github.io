<h2>10: War Stories</h2>
<p><pre>Geppetto:
Coms frequency no longer jammed. Re-establishing. Hello OpCom. Welcome to—

Shaxx:
THIS IS SHAXX; THE ENEMY IS IN FULL RETREAT!

Osiris:
The Northern walls stand—
I am needed.

Saint-14:
Shaxx? Hello? Western Fronts are clear. This is Saint-14.

Shaxx:
AMAZING! THEN WE MARCH ON THE SOUTH.

Saladin:
The Fallen's southern approach has broken. The City holds.

Silence hangs for but a momen—

Shaxx:
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO CRASH IN HERE AND KILL ALL OF US.

The group laughs.

Saladin:
Yes.

Osiris:
All fireteams accounted for. No casualties.

Saint-14:
Thanks to you and my friend Elriq. You should have seen her. She saved eight little Lights. Charged dozens of Fallen with me. Lightning, bullets—it was quite impressive.

Elriq:
You're too kind. It was an honor to fight by your side.

Shaxx:
DOZENS?

Saladin:
I'm impressed, Saint. How many deaths did your charge cost you?

Saint-14:
I did not die. Elriq provided wonderful cover fi—

Shaxx:
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

Saint-14:
Is that because you died, Shaxx? I heard the Fallen broke your horn.

Shaxx:
Where did you hear that?

Elriq:
I can vouch for Saint. We didn't die.

Saint bursts out laughing.

Shaxx:
IF ONLY WE COULD ALL BE MORE LIKE YOU, SAINT.

Saint-14:
As I said, I had excellent cover.

Osiris:
I don't know how many times I died.
I witnessed the battle through the eyes of the City.
Balanced on wire.
We were spread thin.

Saint-14:
My Brother, you have fought hard.
You should be proud. Without you, we would have been lost.

Osiris:
Some were.</pre></p>
