<p>

He might not walk away from this. But they definitely wouldn't.<br/><br/>His Machine Gun spoke much louder than he did, over and over.<br/><br/>He had never brought himself to shoot a human. Or anything even resembling a human. Risen included.<br/><br/>But these were no Risen.

A blue, viscous film covered the dirt, dust, and rocks when he was finished.<br/><br/>"All right," he said, looking appreciably down at his smoking weapon.
