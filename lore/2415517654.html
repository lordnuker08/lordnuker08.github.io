<h2>Bastion</h2>
<p>
My son.<br/><br/>You are a bastion of hope for all who are lost in darkness.<br/><br/>Let this consecrated armament offer protection in times of trial,<br/><br/>strength when you feel most alone,<br/><br/>and guidance when there are no roads.<br/><br/>Your Light will shine on to lead our people into peace.<br/><br/>Let this be a symbol of our dedication to their future.<br/><br/>Know that I am proud.<br/> —Father<br/><br/>The epitaph is barely readable, appearing to have been scraped almost clean from the frame. Below the stricken words, five hash-marks are engraved into the weapon. A small etching in Eliksni reads:<br/><br/> |||||<br/>"dead… little… thieves…"</p>
