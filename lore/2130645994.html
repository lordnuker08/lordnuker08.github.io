Emerald Coast. European Deadzone.<br/><br/>Drifter waited, covering his eyes from the sun as the Derelict descended on a coastline covered in Cabal wreckage.<br/><br/>He keyed a switch on his remote and his ship's Transmat beam dissolved the bank at the center of the battlefield. He couldn't help but chuckle. His Ghost looked at him quizzically.<br/><br/>"Sometimes it is just this easy," Drifter said, shrugging. "The Guardians get paid and we collect our goods. No ambushes, pompous aliens—"<br/><br/>He heard a dull boom behind him over the howl of the Derelict's engines. The sky darkened. He turned to see that Cabal reinforcements had arrived from a massive capital ship above. Armored soldiers landed with heavy thuds in the sand, their weapons a glistening silver.<br/><br/>Drifter's Ghost expanded and its eye went wide. It did this instead of laughing. It couldn't laugh.<br/><br/>"Shut up. Shut up, you idiot." Drifter waved his friend away.<br/><br/>He eyed the approaching squad of soldiers bristling with armor and weapons. The Mote of Dark was cold to the touch in his hand.</p>
