<h1>Shadow's Gauntlets</h1>
</div>
<p>
The Hive left the Crown of Sorrow on one of their war moons, and my Shadows waged such a campaign to take it. We did. And we converted it into an Athenaeum world.<br/><br/>But the Crown was a trap. A trap for me. I suspected as much.<br/><br/>Which is why I did not wear it.<br/><br/>After initial tests, my Psions determined it was a seeing device of sorts, feeding all sorts of data to someone or something deep in the Ascendant Plane.<br/><br/>But seeing devices look both ways. I had to have it. And I had to have someone wear it.<br/><br/>Because I believed I could control the Hive through a Shadow surrogate. The Hive are not true darkness, not what I saw at the black edge. But they would provide an army just the same.<br/><br/>Proud Gahlran was bred specifically to bring them under my control.</p>
