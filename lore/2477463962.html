<h2>Solstice Gauntlets (Resplendent)</h2>
<p>
Beneath a dead tree, Esta Tel scanned the bridge above her as she hurried to fasten the wires at the end of the cable to her detonator. Looked good. Bare road on one end of the bridge, buildings in the way on the other, but everything looked clear from down in the ravine.<br/><br/>The Cabal would be making a run in exactly three minutes. Time to go.<br/><br/>She watched the buildings up above, listening. Heard engine sounds.<br/><br/>When she saw a vehicle come into view, she clicked the detonator. Ten seconds.<br/><br/>But it wasn't Cabal. It was a medical vehicle. Moving fast onto the bridge.<br/><br/>Five seconds. All the blood drained from her face. She decided before she knew what she was doing.<br/><br/>Shouldered her sniper rifle. Aimed for the junction of her wire and the explosives under the bridge. Shot it out. The wire fell as the medical vehicle crossed.<br/><br/>In the distance, she heard the Cabal coming. Finally.<br/><br/>Shoot the explosives.<br/><br/>Click. No more rounds. No time to think.</p>
