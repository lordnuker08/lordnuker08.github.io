<h2>12: Margins Part I</h2>
<p>
Osiris sits in the small stone garden beneath the Traveler; his attempts at communion unsuccessful. He had seen the Speaker stand here for hours. <br/><br/>Ikora had begrudgingly agreed to appear in his place at the Remembrance. Her words were stern, but deep down, she knows victories have lulled in complacency.<br/><br/>There is an imminent, daunting pressure.<br/><br/>A noose awaiting a misstep.<br/><br/>A delicate game.<br/><br/>Braziers cast shadows; distracting shades flickering across his eyes, breaking his concentration.<br/><br/>Osiris breathes.<br/><br/>The stone gardens are endless space. The skyline is razed horizon.<br/><br/>Breathe.<br/><br/>He is alone in the void. Intrusions no more.<br/><br/>There is a point in the depth. It cannot be directly viewed.<br/><br/>Delve. Dive. Deeper.<br/><br/>Still, only a point in the aphotic depth.<br/><br/>The nothing. Expansive.<br/><br/>Osiris sinks to gain new perspective. The point remains.<br/><br/>It is so faint. Distant. Though he knows he can see the Light.<br/><br/>His reach stretched thin. Clarity, in the space between his hand and the point. The osseous-white point. Dim now.<br/><br/>The omnipresence was.<br/><br/>Hungry acknowledgement.<br/><br/>Vast. Himself against the enormity; an endless unfurling midnight. And a lone point.</p>
