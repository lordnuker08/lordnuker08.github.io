<p>
“Commander, as best we can tell, they're all gone. Somehow the Legion found their outpost, and the Hunters say Centurions still hold the ruins. This was the last text transmission we got before the signal died.” <br/>—Sloane <br/><br/>“The fire burned within us. Not by choice, not because we sought the flame. But because there was no other way. <br/><br/>“When you stood before the Forge, there was no doubt. No fear. Not even anger. <br/><br/>“My order stood for generations. We held against the shadow, bearing a weapon that seared flesh and melted bone. <br/><br/>“And now we stand at the end. May history remember the Forge. Remember the Hammer. Remember the Sunbreakers.” <br/><br/>—Ouros, Third and Final Empyreal Magistrate of the Sunbreaker</p>
