<h2>Silicon Neuroma</h2>
<p>
A staggering Vex detonates, and the Exo Hunter is torn in two. One half sinks beneath the lake's opaque surface.<br/><br/>Asher's eyes go wide and he freezes. Whatever they'd stumbled into down here was multiplicatively more lethal. He reloads his fusion rifle and looks around wildly.<br/><br/>The other Hunter—she's the only other one left alive, no, stay calm—throws a smoke bomb and disappears. Asher barely has time to react before the Hunter reappears on high ground and draws a bow of Void energy, almost in slow motion.<br/><br/>Crack! Crack! Crack! Ten Vex fall. Asher watches them disintegrate, looks back up to the Hunter—but the yell of gratitude catches in his throat as four Vex shimmer into existence behind her.<br/><br/>Asher can't watch this time. He frantically searches for a way out… and a tentacle grabs his Ghost.<br/><br/>A millisecond of pain in his shoulder and everything goes white.</p>
