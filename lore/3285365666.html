<h2>Jack Queen King 3</h2>
<p>
From the journals of Ikora Rey<br/><br/>When I studied with Osiris, he would often tell me: "I see failure in your future." No matter how hard I worked, no matter how strong I became, always: "I still see failure."<br/><br/>I think now what he saw was Io.<br/><br/>When I lost my Light and retreated from a ruined City, when I arrived on Io to find only silence, I too thought I had failed. Even after Ghaul's defeat and the Traveler's waking, I told my friends I thought the Traveler had tested me, and that I had failed its test.<br/><br/>But now I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>Perhaps what Osiris saw for me—what I experienced on Io—was simply that I needed help. That most Human of conditions. I needed to be in a fireteam, and to be a fireteam for others in turn.<br/><br/>How like Osiris to see that and name it failure.<br/><br/>I won't make that mistake again.</p>
