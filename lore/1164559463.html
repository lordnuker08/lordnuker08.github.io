<h2>Scales</h2>
<p>
43.<br/><br/>On the day she leaves to find the Nine, the Techeuns name her Orin the Lost. She raids a storeroom in the Vestian Outpost, stuffing into her knapsack digital schematics for a phaeton backscatter scanner, a jade coin, several bundles of dried queensfoil, and nothing more.<br/><br/><br/>44.<br/><br/>She goes beyond the heliopause.<br/><br/>It is a long walk.<br/><br/>A sudden death.<br/><br/><br/>45.<br/><br/>She sheds herself and emerges anew in the glimmering scales of her old lives: an immigrant, a translator, an emissary, a hammer of judgment. They expect to claim her will, but she clenches it a little tighter.<br/><br/>Her gifts can end wars.</p>
