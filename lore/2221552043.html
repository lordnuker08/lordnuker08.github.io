<h2>Hardy's Control</h2>
<p>
Jacob Hardy's Journal<br/>Project Ares One (FKA Catamaran)<br/>Path to Ares: Launch Day +1<br/><br/>We're 24 hours late.<br/>I've never seen the crew in such a crappy mood.<br/><br/>It was so… stupid. An electrical fire in a clubhouse stairwell.  One minute Evie's putting some final touches on her calculations and was headed off to do a telecast about the effect of flash erosion on coastal tides, and the next…<br/><br/>We didn't even notice she was gone.<br/><br/>We learn about cascading events, how catastrophe comes from one thing stacking onto another.<br/><br/> A fried electrical system. A weak sprinkler. Smoke. No one else paying attention. A spill in in the stairwell, making the steps slippery.<br/><br/>Our safe cocoon became a deathtrap.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Of course we're still going.<br/><br/>But Evie put us here. And now we're going to meet the Traveler without her.<br/><br/>The truth is I know I'll lose myself in the amazement of it all. I will. I know it. But just remember I felt this way. <br/><br/>One more thing. They've given us guns and renamed us. Something about needing to be ready for the worst.</p>
