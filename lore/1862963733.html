If you haven't, you must.<br/><br/>And true, it is a place of recreation for my beloved soldiers, but did you know that they are born there? Yes, the joyful, axe-wielding ceremonial bathers are but seconds into their lives when you cut them down.<br/><br/>They are created from genetic patterns of the most virile martial artists of a bygone Cabal era.<br/><br/>And Gahlran, the Sorrow-Bearer, was once one of them. I played with his pattern, made certain he would be strong of mind and will as much as body.<br/><br/>He had but one purpose: bear the Crown of Sorrow and make the Hive mine.<br/><br/>Imagine my chagrin when his very personality was annihilated within minutes of exposure.
