<h2>Shadow's Plate</h2>
<p>
You've no doubt visited the ritual baths aboard the Leviathan, have you not? If you haven't, you must.<br/><br/>And true, it is a place of recreation for my beloved soldiers, but did you know that they are born there? Yes, the joyful, axe-wielding ceremonial bathers are but seconds into their lives when you cut them down.<br/><br/>They are created from genetic patterns of the most virile martial artists of a bygone Cabal era.<br/><br/>And Gahlran, the Sorrow-Bearer, was once one of them. I played with his pattern, made certain he would be strong of mind and will as much as body.<br/><br/>He had but one purpose: bear the Crown of Sorrow and make the Hive mine.<br/><br/>Imagine my chagrin when his very personality was annihilated within minutes of exposure. Whatever viral language was etched into the Crown's interior had taken over.<br/><br/>Until you ended him, he belonged to a witch.<br/><br/>â€”Emperor Calus</p>
