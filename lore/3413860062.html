<h2>The Chaperone</h2>
<p>
"The Last Safe City doesn't exist."<br/><br/>That's what her parents said when Nora Jericho was young. Almost as often as they said, "I'll die before I leave this land."<br/><br/>Nora believed them. She never had a reason not to.<br/><br/>She never forgot the moment she learned her mother could be wrong. It was her tenth birthday.<br/><br/>The same day the four-arms finally breached the bunker that had stood for hundreds of years. The same day a knight in scratched and dented armor fought them offâ€”but not before cruel electric blades sheared through the metal orb hovering at his shoulder.<br/><br/>Nora helped him recover the jagged shreds of a shell. Confused but unquestioning, she helped him bury the pieces.<br/><br/>In thanks, he told her of the Last Safe City. Gave her a map and a shotgun, told her, "good luck," and then walked off into the desert alone.<br/><br/>Nora's mother didn't have room in her life for the upending of worlds. She stayed, along with half the bunker folk, in the desert.<br/><br/>Nora left the next day.</p>
