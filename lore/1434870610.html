<h2>Shadow's Helm</h2>
<p>
I thank you for freeing Gahlran, the Sorrow-Bearer from his waking death beneath the Crown of Sorrow.<br/><br/>Speaking of which.<br/><br/>Don't your kind love to tempt Hive artifacts?<br/><br/>I've been familiarizing myself with Guardian histories, and they say one of you worshipped the Hive to the extent that he betrayed the Light. If this story isn't a sham, a Shadow of your Titan-tribe would be perfect for replacing Gahlran. I need someone hearty like you to carry the Crown in his place.<br/><br/>Will you wear it when I ask you? Because the day will come.<br/><br/>You don't have to answer right now. Think about it. And take this helm in its place for now.</p>
