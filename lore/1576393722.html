<h2>Notorious Reaper Cloak</h2>
<p>
"I want out, man. I just want out." â€”A Dark Age drifter<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>He sat with men who went by the name "Dredgen" in a ritual at least one man had completed before.<br/><br/>Together, they heard whispers. They heard voices. A thousand. Maybe more.<br/><br/>He had always thought they had picked their name for themselves.<br/><br/>But they hadn't. The whispers had given it to them.<br/><br/>He would have found out either way, sooner or later.<br/><br/>Because in another lifetime, he would hear the Cabal Emperor describe his demigods with the same word.<br/><br/>Shadows.<br/><br/>Of Yor.<br/><br/>Of Calus.<br/><br/>Of nothing, as far as he was concerned.</p>
