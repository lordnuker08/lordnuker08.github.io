<p>
You've shown the Red Legion you fly my banner.<br/><br/>I know that when the time is right, I won't have to ask. You're on my side.<br/><br/>I see it when you crack armor and carapace by simply touching it. When you bisect your opponents with searing tears in reality. When you swallow them with your Light, and make them a part of you. It is captivating.<br/><br/>But Earth casts no Shadow. Not yet.<br/><br/>When you're ready, you will be magnificent. A Guardian of Guardians. Shadow of Shadows.<br/><br/>I reserve the right to be last when the end comes, and for that, I need you with me.<br/><br/>You're so close.<br/><br/>â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
