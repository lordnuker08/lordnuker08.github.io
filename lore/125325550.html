<h2>Solstice Plate (Resplendent)</h2>
<p><pre>Lyria Graemer shoved herself further into the nook underneath a cable support and looked down, waiting for Mattox-9 to make his way up. As he climbed using the fasteners she'd driven into the wall of the Tower, he met her eyes and gave a thumbs-up.

Eight more stories and they'd be right below the Speaker and the Cabal brutes who held him. Just a little further.

Graemer heard distant popping and saw puffs of smoke from below. Looking down, she saw Red Legion troops on the ground, firing up at them.

She looked to Mattox. He nodded.

"Climb!" she said, drawing her rifle. He reached her ready to crack a joke—she knew that face—but the clang of metal on metal interrupted him. Mattox's head shot forward, and as it snapped back up, the red light of his eyes flickered to black. Graemer's rifle fell from her hands as she hauled his body up—they could still finish this together.

Shots all around her. She snarled as one caught her in the side. The Cabal weren't letting up.

Graemer activated her grenades and loaded them into Mattox's rocket launcher. Then, clutching the body of her oldest friend, she dove down.

As they reached the enemy, the world exploded to black.</pre></p>
