As he climbed using the fasteners she'd driven into the wall of the Tower, he met her eyes and gave a thumbs-up.<br/><br/>Eight more stories and they'd be right below the Speaker and the Cabal brutes who held him. Just a little further.<br/><br/>Graemer heard distant popping and saw puffs of smoke from below. Looking down, she saw Red Legion troops on the ground, firing up at them.<br/><br/>She looked to Mattox. He nodded.<br/><br/>"Climb!" she said, drawing her rifle.

Graemer's rifle fell from her hands as she hauled his body up—they could still finish this together.<br/><br/>Shots all around her. She snarled as one caught her in the side. The Cabal weren't letting up.<br/><br/>Graemer activated her grenades and loaded them into Mattox's rocket launcher.
