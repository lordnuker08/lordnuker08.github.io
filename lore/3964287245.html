<h2>Wraps of Sekris</h2>
<p>
Desperate. My lovely Baron of Shanks was the most desperate Shadow I ever recruited. He questioned every order I gave, to the point that Valus Nohr required my personal appeasement to prevent the severing of his head.<br/><br/>Every second Humankind was left alive in this system he saw as an affront he demanded I rectify. Had I known how delightful encountering Guardians would be, I would have abided immediately. But those were the days before my dear Dominus had embraced the Light. At that time, what was Humanity to me?<br/><br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
