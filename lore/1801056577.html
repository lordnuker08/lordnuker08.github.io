<h1>Entries 150, 151</h1>

<p>
Entry 150<br/><br/>I put this journal aside for a long time. I've been too tired to write in it. My clothes are looser, and she is concerned that I'm "shedding mass." This is not how I ever wanted to get to know her.<br/><br/>At night, I started singing to myself to calm my nerves. She paid rapt attention and shortly asked me to teach her the song, "Le Temps Des Cerises." She asks how I know it, but I'm in no condition to talk about him. It's just an old family tradition I tell her.<br/><br/>Is it lying? I wonder if it really matters now.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Entry 151<br/><br/>I tried to answer some of her questions. About the Black Armory, about life before the end… about what I believed in. About what makes us who we are. About what makes her who she is.<br/><br/>If you don't know where you come from, how can you know who you are? Our past defines us more than we are willing to admit.<br/><br/>All this—all that is lost—I'm telling her that she should care for it. Our past is precious and needs to be remembered.<br/><br/>I tell her this realizing that I'm the one holding back. I'm the one keeping secrets. I'm the hypocrite. Stopped me from being able to even look at her.<br/><br/>Someday, probably soon, she'll be the only life our legacy has left.<br/><br/>Maybe one day I won't be such a coward. Maybe then I'll tell her everything.</p>
