<h2>Penumbral Cloak</h2>
<p>
"This Cloak is yours. For the day you ignite the spark that casts the Shadow of Earth." —Emperor Calus<br/><br/><br/><br/>THE RECENT PAST. SOMEWHERE ELSE.<br/><br/><br/>I activated the mechanism that opened my chamber doors. The massive gears on either side shrieked in protest as they ground against themselves to wrench the massive, solid-plasteel gates open. It took whole minutes to complete the sequence.<br/><br/>A tiny, tiny man sped through the now-gaping maw of the gates on a tiny Earth machine. It took him several minutes more to reach earshot of me, leaving a billowing trail of dust in his wake. I'm afraid my chamber had not been cleaned in some time. Cleanliness meant nothing to me now. I had not entertained an audience so directly in centuries. But I was as curious about this creature as it was of me.<br/><br/>The miniscule man dismounted his machine and stared up. I pictured I would relish the moment when his eyes went wide at the sight of my grandeur.<br/><br/>But he didn't seem to care. He frowned a little. Fascinating.<br/><br/>"Is that you?" he asked, voice echoing upwards at me. "The real you?"<br/><br/>"Yes," I replied, and the metal around me rattled and shook at my speech. It was the truth. "One of me. Refreshment?"<br/><br/>I activated a mechanism in the floor, raising a miniscule but ornate table out of the dusty metal deck. A single, equally tiny chalice, filled to the brim with royal nectar wine, sat on its center.<br/><br/>"No thanks," the man said. "Last time I drank an alien something, I had a gunfight with what came outta' me."<br/><br/>"What can Emperor Calus do for you?" I asked him.<br/><br/>I pretended to stare at him. In doing so, I analyzed every fiber of his being at a spectrum level. I had always expected he was a Guardian. But there was something else. A shade of something that reminded me of the black edge. So the tiny man liked to play outside the Light.<br/><br/> "I got somewhere to be, so I'll make this short. Where do you and I stand? I need these Guardians as much as you do. We gonna start fighting for territory soon?"<br/><br/>"The Shadows are mine," I boomed, pelting him with my voice. He winced. I wasn't angry. I didn't have it in me to be angry anymore. But he had to know.<br/><br/>"So that's a yes," he muttered, and flipped a jade coin into the air with a clink that echoed throughout the massive chamber.<br/><br/>"There isn't a sane being in this whole system," he grumbled up at the coin, then caught it.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure I know what you mean," I said. It was truth. Data from my spectral analysis of the peasant continued to pour in.<br/><br/>He stared at me. "You're crazy. Those Guardians you got working for you—they're crazy. The Vanguard's crazy."<br/><br/>He looked down at his coin. "I might be crazy."<br/><br/>He chuckled, suddenly. "I leave the system for a couple hundred years and everything goes to hell." He shook his head. "Look at you. The Cabal Emperor isn't even Cabal anymore. Right?"<br/><br/>"I am the last thing this system shall ever see," I replied. My scan was finished. And so was this man's welcome in my abode. I think he knew, because he turned to leave.<br/><br/>"You come after what's mine, and I've got friends in low places who'll tear your house down," he called back to me. I glimpsed his smile, and it was full of teeth.<br/><br/>I laughed as he sped away on his machine.<br/><br/>His friends were mine first.</p>
