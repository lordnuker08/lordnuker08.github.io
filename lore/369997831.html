<h2>Zephyr</h2>
<p>
Snow Leopard paces before his hoard.<br/>Panther's footfalls do not exist.<br/>He looks over his shoulder.<br/>She is not seen.<br/>He whirls, claw and fang.<br/>She is already past.<br/>His blade drops.<br/>She is not fooled.<br/>His teeth are razors.<br/>Her blade is sharper.<br/>His blade is on her.<br/>She is not there.<br/>His blood is up.<br/>Her blood is ice.<br/>His blood colors the ground.<br/>She moves to finish him.<br/>He smiles after his strike is true.<br/>She hisses.<br/>He roars.<br/>She slows, warmth and languor.<br/>He jerks, chill and agita.<br/>She brings the gale, hot and fierce.<br/>He is still, until the next winter.</p>
