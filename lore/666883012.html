<h2>Gauntlets of Nohr</h2>
<p>
The Valus desired true agency, and perished before she received it. Such is the life of a Shadow, and a common occurrence among their kind. It's their one commonality.<br/><br/>She was a Loyalist to the end, and I could not have asked for a better warrior and confidant at my side all these years. She was Cabal through and through. One of the last.<br/><br/>â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
