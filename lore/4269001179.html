<h2>Solstice Cloak (Resplendent)</h2>
<p>
Before they took the Traveler away, we thought we were tough. All of us. But man, without the Ghosts, we became real vulnerable for a while. At least I did. Ghaul absolutely had us pegged.<br/><br/>A bunch of Fallen were trying to establish a base of operations near the old Nessus crash site after the boss left. When Trake and I arrived on Nessus to help organize resistance against the Red Legion, we engaged the Fallen—we couldn't let them build up their forces.<br/><br/>So the ground trembles when one of the Fallen transports blows up, and I lose my grip on my rifle—it slips right down the ridge we're taking cover behind. I've never felt so stupid, and I… I couldn't move.<br/><br/>Trake shakes me out of my stupor, and we scramble over the ridge to get my rifle. I slide down and grab it while he covers me. It feels like the world is frozen in place. I can still picture him shooting round after round as we head back to safety.<br/><br/>He's right on my heels, but… I'm sorry. No, he, uh, he was hit in the neck and, uh, that was it.<br/><br/>The fear—I can't describe it at all. But I remember it in my bones.</p>
