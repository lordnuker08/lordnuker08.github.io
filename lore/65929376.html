I am [Riven]. My work on the Dreaming [City] is complete.<br/><br/>I have done everything [the Queen] asked of me. But this is a [bargain].<br/><br/>I did so much more than that.<br/><br/>[The Queen] and her ilk will not understand for some time, though I think [the Queen] can see the signs. What I carved into the small corners. In the Wall of [Wishes] itself.<br/><br/>This will be a beautiful [City].<br/><br/>But not a safe [City].</p>
