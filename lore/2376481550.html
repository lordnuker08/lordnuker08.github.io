<h2>Anarchy</h2>
<p>
"You little rat. You took my warm hospitality and stomped all over it like an ungrateful child. Is that any way to treat one of your dear 'brethren'?"<br/><br/>Siviks laughed. A cold, twisted laugh. Then offered up a large wad of spit at the Spider's feet.<br/><br/>The Spider just rolled his eyes. "Let me know when you're ready to make nice," he said. <br/><br/>Siviks' laugh now grew into something maniacal. He topped it off with another wad of spit, this time directly in the Spider's face. <br/><br/>Once he'd wiped his brow, the Spider leaned forward, looking Siviks in the eyes, and said, "I think our little rat here needs a time out. Perhaps someplace with the rest of the vermin." <br/><br/>The many hands of Spider's men gripped and restrained Siviks. As they dragged him off, he shouted, "You… as bad as all Fallen! Worse, even! A friend even to humans… All must die!" <br/><br/>The Spider simply waved goodbye, taunting, "Bon voyage, my friend!" <br/><br/>Once Siviks had gone, the Spider looked longingly toward where he had stood. He sighed a deep, regretful sigh before continuing with business as usual.</p>
