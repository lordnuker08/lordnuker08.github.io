<h2>Dawning Cheer</h2>
<p>
"What is that?"<br/><br/>Grinning, Kasim stood back to let the kids get a better look at his Sparrow. "It's Kringle's sleigh."<br/><br/>"Who's that?" barked Runa. At eleven, she was the oldest of the group.<br/><br/>"Mr. Kringle," said Kasim, who had been reading all about pre-Collapse traditions. "Every Dawning, Kringle visits the good children of the City. He comes at night, while you're asleep, and leaves presents in your house."<br/><br/>"But the door's locked because of prowlers," Tomas said.<br/><br/>"He slithers down the chimney," Kasim said. Or was it 'slides'?<br/><br/>"How does he fit?" asked Matsuko, the youngest.<br/><br/>"Well." Kasim hesitated. "He's magic…" <br/><br/>"So he's a Guardian," Runa said.<br/><br/>"No, he's not a Guardian."<br/><br/>The children exchanged looks and erupted into nervous chatter. <br/><br/>"If there's a fire in the fireplace, can he still get in?" Tomas asked, alarmed.<br/><br/>"He can't get hurt by the fire." Kasim was losing steam. "Listen. He—"<br/><br/>"He's immune to fire," Runa said gravely.<br/><br/>Matsuko started to cry. Tomas kicked the Sparrow. "Hey!" Kasim said. "Listen! He's not real, OK? Kringle's not real. He's made up." He moved the Sparrow away. "Just… forget I said anything."<br/><br/>Runa watched Kasim go. "Don't worry," she told Matsuko. "Lord Shaxx will stop Kringle."</p>
