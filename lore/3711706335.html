From the Diaries of Dr. Shanice Pell <br/>Darling, the installation is nearly complete. Between Ishtar's endless audits and Clovis Bray's network protocols, I thought we would never make it. Secret the initial blueprints in hand-to-hand relays, recruit personnel brave enough to challenge the Traveler at its own game, secure mining rights in the Belt for materials… I remember when it was just a dream in our heads. At last, the freedom and silence to pierce interstellar space for our own answers! Tomorrow, I'm bringing the girls to see the navigation probe launch. They still ask about you from time to time. I just tell them, that's why we're out here, to find you.</p>
