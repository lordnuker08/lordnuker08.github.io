Your Ghost makes a list of the things he wishes he could say to you.<br/><br/>"Talk to me about how you feel."<br/><br/>"I wish we would go home."<br/><br/>"You're on a rampage, and I'm not comfortable with it."<br/><br/>"I don't think this is why the Traveler chose you."<br/><br/>"You know I'll never leave you, right?"<br/><br/>"But sometimes… I don't like the look in your eyes."<br/><br/>Every day, the list grows longer. <br/><br/>"I'm here. I'm still here."<br/><br/>"Are you still here?"<br/><br/>"I don't want to lose you to this."<br/><br/>"I love you."</p>
