"What is the Darkness?"<br/><br/>You open your eyes to gaze upon your weary soul, seeking an answer to your question.<br/><br/>You see a world in the space B E T W E E N.<br/><br/>You see only what the Light left you: every day there will ever be, unmarred. Forever.<br/><br/>For you and all those like you.<br/><br/>But the Dark has returned.<br/><br/>And when Light and Dark meet, universes collapse.<br/><br/>Not something to mourn. Natural order.<br/><br/>But we believe you exist to buck natural order. You always did. Even before the Dark.<br/><br/>Before the Light.<br/><br/>When it was just you. And those like you.<br/><br/>We would learn more.<br/><br/>The heavens above you are clear of stars and shadows.<br/><br/>Your feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.<br/><br/>Your bond's glow is dim; there is no Light here. Or Dark.</p>
