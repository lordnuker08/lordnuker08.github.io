<h2>Message from Aunor I</h2>
<p>
CORMORANT-LEVEL ENCRYPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS. AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.<br/><br/>My name is Aunor. I serve the Hidden and the Warlock Praxic Order. You and I have never met, but I hold you in high regard.<br/><br/>You've accomplished wonders for this City, and humanity owes you a debt it cannot repay. A marvel for one so young.<br/><br/>But, in true Guardian fashion, nothing you did for the City came from generosity.<br/><br/>I think you want what everyone with power wants: more.<br/><br/>The man called Drifter knows this. That man has done what past influencers could not: manipulate Guardians into dabbling with the dark.<br/><br/>And yet the Vanguard stands by in silence.<br/><br/>Commander Zavala and Ikora Rey know who he is and everything he stands for.<br/><br/>They still let him bring his Gambit into the system. What's more, they have forbidden the Praxic Order from interfering.<br/><br/>It's against everything the Praxics stand for. We won't abide it, and we're looking into his activities, building a case against him even the Vanguard can't ignore.<br/><br/>Do me a favor. From one Guardian of this City to another.<br/><br/>You're free to keep your business with him. Just give me the chance to convince you the Drifter's not to be trusted.</p>
