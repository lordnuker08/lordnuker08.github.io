"What is the Darkness?"<br/><br/>You open your eyes and gaze upon your weary soul, seeking an answer to your question.<br/><br/>You don't recognize what you see, here in this world full of L I G H T.<br/><br/>It looks different from what you remember, but you can't remember what that was.<br/><br/>You remember the Cosmodrome. You remember your many lives since then.<br/><br/>But were they really you?<br/><br/>Because you died. You die. All the time.<br/><br/>How do you know that's not a whole new Hunter climbing out of that crater?<br/><br/>What if those other Hunters, those other you, are still dead?<br/><br/>Do you care? Do they?<br/><br/>Your vision gradually returnsâ€¦<br/><br/>A harsh glare blooms from the heavens above.<br/><br/>Something grips your hands, desperately shaking them.<br/><br/>Your feet find purchase in shifting sands.<br/><br/>Your cloak billows in the wind, yet something clings to it, weighing it down.</p>
