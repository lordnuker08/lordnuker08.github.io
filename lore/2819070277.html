<h2>Dinas Emrys</h2>
<p><pre>Consensus Meeting 3234.43 
Zavala: “Guardian Ariadne Gris. Have you had contact with an Ahamkara?” 
Ariadne Gris: “No!” 
New Monarchy: “Then why does your Sparrow bear a dragon logo?” 
AG: “Because dragons are cool.” 
NM: “If Ms. Gris won't take this seriously—” 
Cayde-6: “Play nice, Ari. Hideo's knickers are real tight today.”  
AG: “I thought a dragon'd look cool on my Sparrow. Not all dragons are Ahamkaras!” 
Z: “Ikora? Your perspective?” 
Ikora Rey: “I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Are we really still talking about this?” 
Dead Orbit: *muffled laughter* 
IR: “Obviously Gris has not had contact with an Ahamkara.” 
FWC: “How do you know?” 
IR: “If she had, she'd win SRL more often.” 
C6: *whistle* 
AG: “Harsh, Rey.” 
Z: “Then let the record show: the Consensus's official stance on the Dinas Emrys dragon symbol is: cool.”</pre></p>
