<h2>Dinas Emrys</h2>
<p>
Consensus Meeting 3234.43 <br/>Zavala: “Guardian Ariadne Gris. Have you had contact with an Ahamkara?” <br/>Ariadne Gris: “No!” <br/>New Monarchy: “Then why does your Sparrow bear a dragon logo?” <br/>AG: “Because dragons are cool.” <br/>NM: “If Ms. Gris won't take this seriously—” <br/>Cayde-6: “Play nice, Ari. Hideo's knickers are real tight today.”  <br/>AG: “I thought a dragon'd look cool on my Sparrow. Not all dragons are Ahamkaras!” <br/>Z: “Ikora? Your perspective?” <br/>Ikora Rey: “I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Are we really still talking about this?” <br/>Dead Orbit: *muffled laughter* <br/>IR: “Obviously Gris has not had contact with an Ahamkara.” <br/>FWC: “How do you know?” <br/>IR: “If she had, she'd win SRL more often.” <br/>C6: *whistle* <br/>AG: “Harsh, Rey.” <br/>Z: “Then let the record show: the Consensus's official stance on the Dinas Emrys dragon symbol is: cool.”</p>
