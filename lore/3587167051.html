<p>
(Nine hundred.)<br/>Should have known better. Those were pretty words, but come on. Marcus was never going to lose to me.<br/>(Eight hundred.)<br/>All the practicing, the two knee sprains… throw it on the pile of wasted effort.<br/>(Seven hundred.)<br/>So this is it. I'll sell off the bird, obviously. That should get me enough Glimmer to stock up for going back to patrols full-time.<br/>(Six hundred.)<br/>Yeah, I see you, Ren. I might never beat you out here, but we'll always pull each other out of the fire in the field.<br/>(Five hundred.)<br/>Wha…<br/>(Four hundred.)<br/>No way. Marcus, don't flame out now.<br/>(Three hundred.)<br/>…<br/>(Two hundred.)<br/>!!!<br/>(One hundred.)<br/>By the Traveler. I'm actually gonna…<br/>(Finish.)<br/>Marcus. Did you see me? I did it. I won. I WON. Maybe… maybe I don't have to give up. "Enoch Bast, Champion Sparrow Racer" sounds better than "Enoch Bast, Grunt Who's Really Good at Patrols."<br/>Time to enjoy this.</p>
