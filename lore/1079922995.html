<h2>Eriana's Vengeance</h2>
<p><pre>To Wei Ning— 
More than anything, I hate the idea that we will be remembered as a tragedy. That's not true. I reserve that distinction for the monster that took you from me. But I know it's what you would hate the most. You, who were always so full of laughter. 

So now, in this moment, as the ship named for my vengeance flies me and five others to Luna, I will remember the happy times. 

Our first meeting, in the Tower saloon. Your laugh made the glasses clatter. You bought three rounds for the entire room. Pahanin introduced us. You sat me down next to you and plied me with questions about Stormtrances. All things that on any other night would have annoyed me. But that night—because it was you—I knew then and there that I never wanted to be without you.</pre></p>
