<h1>Ancient Apocalypse Cloak</h1>

<p>
The Drifter walked along the shoreline, past the wreckage of Cabal shields and armor. His Primevals had done their work.<br/><br/>He gripped a massive hand cannon in his fist, and his Ghost buzzed around his head like a carrion fly. Drifter scanned the battlefield as he walked, making note of the weapons and the scrap he would have the Derelict's AI transmat to the hangar.<br/><br/>He ambled up to a dying Psion amidst the wreckage of a Harvester torn in half, and stared down at it as it bled.<br/><br/>The front of its skull started to glow, a telltale sign that it was trying to throw its mind up at the Drifter.<br/><br/>He stepped forward and kicked it squarely in the head.<br/><br/>He knelt down.<br/><br/>"All the people who matter say we're on the precipice of a new Golden Age. I'm still trying to figure out what that means. But I can tell you this: the last time humanity had a Golden Age, we owned this system. Every inch of it."<br/><br/>He leaned in to whisper into where the Psion's ears would be if it had ears.<br/><br/>"And not all of us are as polite as the ones up in that Tower." A monstrous bark from his hand cannon rang out, the only sound for miles around.</p>
