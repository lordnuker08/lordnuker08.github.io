<h2>Gnomic</h2>
<p>
He is he is not he is walking in the Garden. He is talking silent singing.<br/><br/>^K^KV^V^V^V^V<br/><br/>(Watch your six don't worry about me grow grow grow)<br/><br/>He holsters his gun to gesture he holsters his gun to drink his gun is rusted into its holster and he will never pull it out again.<br/><br/>(How bad can it be how bad can it be how can we grow grow grow)<br/><br/>A Titan is a Wall a Shield a Cup filling itself to overflowing. The container changes the shape of its contents but the contents change the nature of the container and the nature is eternity.<br/><br/>(Who knows what's listening it's listening it's saying grow grow grow)<br/><br/>There is a shape that is his mind and the shape is protect the shape is sacrifice the shape is (grow)<br/><br/>^V^V^V^V^V<br/><br/>He was named too well he is his own grave and the cut on his left hand will never heal.</p>
