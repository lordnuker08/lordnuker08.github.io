Mihaylova Supplemental<br/>Navigator's Journal—Encrypted Supplemental—<br/>A/V Recording<br/>Clubhouse Canteen<br/>Path to Ares: 3 days to Launch<br/><br/>Evie: Listen, I wanted to talk to you alone.<br/><br/>Mihaylova: All right.<br/><br/>E: Have you read some of these outputs? I think there are some serious errors here.<br/><br/>M: Don't be absurd.<br/><br/>E: You've got… it's got these code caches and it's… M, it's creating assessments of us. Of the project, of the crew. It commented on Qiao's snoring when he was asleep. Look, here…<br/><br/>M: Did you print that out?<br/><br/>E: Of course.<br/><br/>M: OK. All right. So what do you propose?<br/><br/>E: Bringing it to Hardy.<br/><br/>M: Ugh. Of course.<br/><br/>E: What's that supposed to mean?<br/><br/>M: I mean… look. Um. You're right. It must be an error. This is all embarrassing. Let me see if I can fix it. Give me a day.<br/><br/>E: We don't have a day!<br/><br/>M: Twelve hours, then. Let me try to locate the problem. And if I can't, of course we'll take it to the whole team.<br/><br/>E: Are you certain you can?<br/><br/>M: Oh, I have to. Twelve hours. By then I swear, we'll have it all squared away.</p>
