The readings were all over the charts like in the other dig sites, but the borer broke into a tunnel and… Well, we almost hit it with the borer. The machine chewed through a pillar or something that held it up, and—" <br/><br/>"It? So what is it? What does it look like? Show me the feed, the diagnostics, everything." <br/><br/>"I don't have any of that." <br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"That's why I'm here. Instruments failed the moment we broke through. The borer too."<br/><br/>"Some sort of EMP? But your suits—"<br/><br/>"Worked just fine. We checked and rechecked everything." <br/><br/>"So what is this thing?"<br/><br/>"Nothing like what I expected. You have to see it for yourself."<br/><br/>"I think I do."<br/><br/>"I'll help you get your suit on."</p>
