Hawthorne walked through the courtyard, her eyes trained on Zavala. He stood looking out over the City, but turned as she approached. "Suraya," he said, inclining his head.<br/><br/>"I want to compete in the Guardian Games," she said.<br/><br/>Zavala paused. "Ah," he began. "Well, I'd imagined them as being…" He studied the unchanging expression on her face: expectant, determined, prepared for an argument. "For Guardians."<br/><br/>"I've seen the events," she said. "I can't do them all, but some don't seem Guardian-exclusive. I can collect resources. I can clear out Lost Sectors. Don't need to be a Guardian for that."<br/><br/>"True," Zavala said. "But…"<br/><br/>Hawthorne leaned close to him and dropped her voice. "When we were taking back the City, you said…"<br/><br/>"I remember what I said," Zavala murmured.<br/><br/>"You called me 'Guardian.'

"All of them."<br/><br/>"You have to choose."<br/><br/>Hawthorne crossed her arms. She studied Zavala. "Titans."<br/><br/>Zavala opened his mouth, then closed it again. "I'm not going to FORBID it, but…"<br/><br/>"Great," Hawthorne said, turning to go. "See you at the award ceremony."</p>
