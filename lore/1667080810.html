<h2>Celestial Nighthawk</h2>
<p>
I'm on the ground, half inside Mav's Ward. Lucky for me, it's my head that's half in. The stars over my head are going out one at a time, but that could just be Taken goo blocking my sight. <br/><br/>This giant one-eyed nightmare we woke up is real unhappy to see us. This wasn't the plan—we just came here to rob him. <br/><br/>Luna's dry. The 'horn's dull. Mav's either laughing, or screaming for her life spraying lead everywhere. She's floating past Psions that won't stop splitting. STOP SPLITTING. <br/><br/>We're almost out of time. We have one shot. <br/>So I pull out the bird and give this sucker the finger. <br/>One red-hot glowing finger.</p>
