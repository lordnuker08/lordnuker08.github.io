<h2>Notorious Reaper Mark</h2>
<p>
"She was a snake." â€”A Dark Age drifter<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>The first time he met her, the starkest thing about her was her tattoo. A snake, coiled on her arm. He would remember that snake when he realized he needed a symbol to motivate the masses in another lifetime. For a game he called Gambit.<br/><br/>It was before the rise of the place humanity would come to call the Last Safe City. He was a true drifter floating from place to place like smoke. Some people had taken to calling him Drifter. He had many names, and he went by none of them.<br/><br/>She knew him then as Eli. And the second time he met her, he asked, "Would you like to dance before you go?"<br/><br/>"Not now," she had said.<br/><br/>"Wait, what did you think I said?" he asked.<br/><br/>"Would you like to dance?" she repeated.<br/><br/>"I would love to," he said, and stepped forward with his arms in the air.<br/><br/>She chuckled.<br/><br/>He paused.<br/><br/>"This has never worked before," he said.<br/><br/>He joined her in the Pilgrim Guard. They fought alongside each other. He saved her life. She saved his.<br/><br/>He was convinced she was his best friend.<br/><br/>He was wrong. One day, he never saw her again.<br/><br/>Not as she was.</p>
