<p>
The unenlightened wonder at my so-called "fixation" upon the Vex. They believe our gravest existential threat is the Hive, for those beings have made a pact with the Darkness itself via the medium of the Worm Gods (according to Toland, at least, and I see no reason to doubt him in this).<br/><br/>But Darkness is not merely absence of Light. Darkness is an entity unto itself. Put simply, Darkness is not Nothing.<br/><br/>But the Vex? The Vex seek neither Light nor Darkness. They seek Convergence, the reduction of all life to its simplest, most meaningless form. An entelechy of zeros and ones.<br/><br/>"Evil" is a word for sentimentalists and fools. But, in the ontology of the sentimental, the Vex are more deserving of the term than the Hive.<br/><br/>Given a choice between Darkness and Convergence, I would choose Darkness. It is a logical choice.<br/><br/>Yet for this they banish me.</p>
