RECORD: 9046G766$LUN-0.346 [RECUSAL MIRROR RECORD]<br/>IDENTITIES: Mike Loftus, Liam Yan <br/>LOCATION: K1 Dig Site 3, Anomaly Observation<br/>THREAT DETECT: Level 5—Possible Exotic<br/>THREAT RESPONSE: Record for Posterity<br/>   [REVISED RESPONSE]: Exhibit Record 501, FILE//REPORT TO RASPUTIN<br/><br/><br/>"Here. Listen to this."<br/><br/>"We've been listening to it for the last two hours. I just needed a break."<br/><br/>"No, I know. But you really need to hear this."<br/><br/>"Fine. Shift is almost over anyway. Might as well suckle the last of that sweet nightmare milk."<br/><br/>SILENCE//00:01:37<br/><br/>"So?"<br/><br/>"Yup."<br/><br/>"That's it? Yup?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. It's a new pattern. That seemed super interesting two hours ago, but it got old. I am bored, and I am tired. And when our shift is over, I probably won't be able to sleep until two hours before I have to get up and do it all over again."<br/><br/>"Look at where the signal is coming from."<br/><br/>"What do you mean? It's right in front of us."<br/><br/>"Check the ambit on the PQZ."<br/><br/>"That's weird."<br/><br/>"Uh huh."<br/><br/>"So it's an echo?"<br/><br/>"Well the pattern repeats. First from here. And then from out there."<br/><br/>"So you think it's bouncing the signal off something outside the system? You're crazy."<br/><br/>"I'm not. Also, this kind of signal doesn't bounce. What can it hit between phasic realities?"<br/><br/>"Nothing…" [whistles]<br/><br/>"Still eager for your shift to end?"<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//EXPOSURE LIMIT REACHED. EXIT OBSERVATION.</p>
