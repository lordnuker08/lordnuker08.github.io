[Report by VanNet encrypted router.]<br/><br/>The enemy is convinced of the rightness of its cause. Uninteresting.<br/><br/>[Personal notes, scratched in Hive leather with a flake of Ionian stone.]<br/><br/>I saw a strange Ghost yesterday, lurking among my supplies. Normally, they do not come this close, even when their Guardians do. They fear possession by the Pyramid.<br/><br/>But this one had the air of a spy.<br/><br/>The enemy warns me of great atrocities couched in valor, violence born from supreme conviction. This message is an extension of the "camouflage" logograph. A warning against my own comrades.<br/><br/>Sometimes, death comes not from a disease but the body's immune reaction. Under pressure, oxygen becomes poison. Good things, Mara says, can make us sick…<br/><br/>Zavala is not a martinet. He is a strategist. His Guardians are all tacticians. They love when some grand new threat appears; but when it is defeated, they become restless, and they use their bold victories as proof that Zavala is a timid leader.<br/><br/>But he is not swayed by the hot-blooded elite. He fears victory disease. What will happen when our mighty newborn Guardians, accustomed to swift victory, meet a grinding, tedious foe?<br/><br/>And he worries for the thousands and thousands of weaker Lightbearers who rush after their heroes and die forever. No more Ghosts are being created. We are pouring from a shallow cup.<br/><br/>He would do anything to protect the Last City. Such is his conviction.<br/><br/>Would he kill me, if he thought I was turned? I think it would wound him horribly. But he does love to be hurt by his duty…<br/><br/>[a small space]<br/><br/>Enina returned with the pine-apple seeds.<br/><br/>Io does not support agriculture, so I made loam out of treated soil, asteroid powder, and a bacterial paste that looks like bouillon. I will plant the pine-apple seeds in this little garden. I hope their roots are not too big. I have only a little room to grow.</p>
