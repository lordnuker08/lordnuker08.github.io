Her throat tasted like metal.<br/><br/>Patience. Breathing. Focus.<br/><br/>The pregnant silence when animals go underground. The dance of water on the roof. The gentle sway of curtains on a humid evening. The distant beat of thunder.<br/><br/>The Wizards, howling now.<br/><br/>Patience. Breathing. Focus.<br/><br/>The dark clouds grew heavier, and each of her bones thrummed with longing. She braided her hands in preparation, gathered herself inward, upward. She turned to run for the Wizards, who danced screaming over the corpse of her friend. The static came with her, wreaths of electricity, brightening at each step.
