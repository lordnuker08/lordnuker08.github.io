"There are symbols in this world—beacons of hope in dark times. We look to them to find inspiration to go on when hope seems lost.<br/><br/>"We need them now more than ever. In these disconcerting times, uncertainty and speculation have run rampant and grown wild. Burn it down. Raze it to ash.<br/><br/>"Remind them what Warlocks stand for. We are the inextinguishable Dawn shining through the midnight Darkness. They look to us as a lodestar. Show them the way forward.<br/><br/>"Be the symbol, Guardian. Embolden your friends and allies.<br/><br/>"Together, nothing can stop us."<br/><br/>—Ikora Rey</p>
