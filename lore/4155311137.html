<h2>The Gate Lord's Eye</h2>
<p><pre>An iris unfurls. Our gaze caught. Cortex clutched. Suspended.

A million lights bend inward. Pulled on a wave of enigmatic tone.

A million lights rip inward. Fall. Link. Scream. Cycle. Bleed. Blend. Cycle.

One light alone. Pulled. Discordant. Suspended in the Endless.

Screams.

An iris unfurls.

Run. Run. Run.

An iris unfurls.

Run. Run.

An iris unfurls.

Run.

Blink. An iris folds in.</pre></p>
