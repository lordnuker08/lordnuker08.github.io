"Listen to me very carefully. They're coming for you. They'll ask you for a name. Your name is Felwinter.'" <br/>"I don't think that's my name." <br/>"I know. Say it anyway." <br/>"Why can't I remember my name? I always remember my name. Something's wrong. Was I damaged in Crypt processing?" <br/>"I don't know anything about the Deep Stone Crypt. Before my time." <br/>"What the hell are you?" <br/>"You don't trust me." <br/>"No." <br/>"You will." <br/>"You're a very presumptuous little drone. What makes you think that?" <br/>"No one else will help you. It's kill or die out there."</p>
