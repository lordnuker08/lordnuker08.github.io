<p><pre>"Listen to me very carefully. They're coming for you. They'll ask you for a name. Your name is Felwinter.'" 
"I don't think that's my name." 
"I know. Say it anyway." 
"Why can't I remember my name? I always remember my name. Something's wrong. Was I damaged in Crypt processing?" 
"I don't know anything about the Deep Stone Crypt. Before my time." 
"What the hell are you?" 
"You don't trust me." 
"No." 
"You will." 
"You're a very presumptuous little drone. What makes you think that?" 
"No one else will help you. It's kill or die out there."</pre></p>
