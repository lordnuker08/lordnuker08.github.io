"What is the Darkness?"<br/><br/>You open your eyes and gaze down at your feet, seeking an answer to your question.<br/><br/>You see that your boots have found purchase in a plain of shifting sands that burns white hot as it reflects scalding light from the heavens in this world full of L I G H T.<br/><br/>Staring directly at the ground, you avoid the worst of a bout of photokeratitis. The wind roars around you.<br/><br/>The shifting sand is all you see.<br/><br/>As you continue to stare, it occurs to you that the Tower might look similar if you stood still for long enough. And your boots, sheathed as they are in a thin veneer of Light, would stay pristine.<br/><br/>You smell a rotting stench.<br/><br/>A harsh glare blooms from the heavens above.<br/><br/>Something grips your hands, desperately shaking them.<br/><br/>Your soul is weary.<br/><br/>Your cloak billows in the wind, yet something clings to it, weighing it down.</p>
