<h1>Spicy Ramen Coupon</h1>
<div/>
<p>
What can I say? A classy order for a classy Exo. I'll try to make time to explain why Spicy Ramen is the one and only ramen shop that you and yours will ever want to eat at. <br/><br/>First, the food. Those fresh golden noodles swimming in rich flavorful broth. Wouldn't surprise me if it was a Golden Age recipe. That combination of salt and the spice just—BAM!—hits you right in the mouth zone. And those pork dumplings? W-O-W! Don't get me started on those dumplings. Where did they even find the pork?<br/><br/>And how about that ambiance? There's the City. Love the City. And the people walking around. Who doesn't like people?<br/><br/>Cons? Heard folks say the Glimmer prices are a bit high. Look, I get it. Unlike yours truly, maybe you aren't sitting on a pile of Glimmer. If you need to scrape Glimmer together maybe we can work something out, I've got some caches that need to be found that are muy caliente… I'm getting sidetracked here. Look, if you know me, or know my chicken… well, maybe not the chicken, but if you know me—and trust me, I know me—you will love Spicy Ramen. Just tell them I sent you. Give them this coupon. I'm good for it.<br/><br/>Make sure you tell them that I sent you. Cayde-6. Sounds like spade but with a C. Capital C. +6. C-A-Y-D-E. Six (not seven).<br/><br/>—Cayde-6</p>
