<h2>Eternal Warrior</h2>
<p>
There is but one great truth in this life:<br/>To live is to fight. <br/><br/>When you are weary with wounds<br/>Heavy with the weight of combat<br/>Think of your ancestors<br/>See the world through their eyes<br/>Everything new and unknown<br/>A shadow world with sharp teeth<br/>and unforgiving intentions<br/><br/>Think of those who came before<br/>Fighting through the endless dark of the unknown<br/>Burning with resolve and strength<br/>Their passion lighting their path<br/><br/>Feel their flame<br/>And know the one great truth<br/><br/>For they were champions<br/>and through your deeds they will live forever</p>
