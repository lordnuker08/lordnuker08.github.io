<h2>Eternal Warrior</h2>
<p><pre>There is but one great truth in this life:
To live is to fight. 

When you are weary with wounds
Heavy with the weight of combat
Think of your ancestors
See the world through their eyes
Everything new and unknown
A shadow world with sharp teeth
and unforgiving intentions

Think of those who came before
Fighting through the endless dark of the unknown
Burning with resolve and strength
Their passion lighting their path

Feel their flame
And know the one great truth

For they were champions
and through your deeds they will live forever</pre></p>
