[Report by VanNet encrypted router.]<br/><br/>Another rhetorical gambit. The enemy presents itself as part of a natural cycle. Like a stalking wolf, it simply obeys its nature. How can we hate it for that?<br/><br/>[Personal notes, scored in Hive leather with a knife.]<br/><br/>There are jaded Guardians, strangers to true loss, who claim that the Traveler has ulterior motives, and the Darkness is a natural force. They worship grey. For them, the line between right and wrong is fine as silk and just as easy to cut.<br/><br/>Fools. Evil is real, even in a world of grey. It must be named and fought, because left unchecked, it takes everything. Those who excuse and deny evil's existence are its greatest allies; those who mistake its causes for moral justification are its favorite pawns.<br/><br/>Yet the Pyramid challenges me. Would not the Light destroy the Darkness, just as Darkness would destroy the Light? Why do we call a change "evil" when it is natural and inevitable, like Earth's winters or the sun's spots?<br/><br/>Because some changes must be resisted. If we did not prepare for winter, we would die in it. We would cease to exist.<br/><br/>…so now I find myself using the enemy's philosophy to justify my opposition to the enemy. A neat little trap.<br/><br/>Is winter evil? It CAUSES evil. It leads us into evil choices through scarcity and pain. But winter is the result of natural circumstance. Even if it had a mind, it could never choose to become an endless summer. It would always hurt us, simply by being itself. Does that make it evil?<br/><br/>And if we were to build shelters and weapons out of ice, would we become evil?<br/><br/>Survival in winter requires wintercraft. Survival in darkness requires… a new idea of good and evil. One that will not collapse into moral indifference.<br/><br/>Or we will all be Dredgens in the end.</p>
