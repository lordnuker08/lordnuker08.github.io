"On today's expedition one of our junior researchers got lost for over an hour in a snow storm. If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times—bright colors only! We're trying to stay alive out here, not play hide-and-seek in the snow. She definitely learned her lesson, though, and after a few cups of hot cocoa her spirits seem to have returned."<br/><br/>—Project Manager, BrayTech R&D</p>
