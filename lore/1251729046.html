<h2>Steelfeather Repeater</h2>
<p>
"I feel the recoil of the weapon and loosen my grip. The more I fight it, the more it fights me.<br/><br/>"I choose to let it lead. <br/><br/>"It finds the milky cores and bursts them with a satisfying combustion, radiolarian fluid glinting in the light. It guides me as I support it. <br/><br/>"We work in tandem, a brilliant dance of destruction, leaving nothing but ruin in our wake.  Nothing can stop this union."<br/><br/>â€”Saint-14</p>
