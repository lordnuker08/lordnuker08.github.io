<h2>Shinobu's Vow</h2>
<p>
I don't know how to write this.<br/><br/>I died.<br/><br/>Well, Shinobu died.<br/><br/>This is hard.<br/><br/>But she—I?—she must have kept this journal for a reason. So here goes.<br/><br/>One of the Hunters, Nadiya, told me most Guardians were dead for centuries before Ghosts find them, when all traces of their first lives are long gone. "Nadiya" is a name she chose for herself.<br/><br/>"Shinobu isn't your name anymore," Nadiya said.<br/><br/>"It could be," I said.<br/><br/>Then Nadiya said, "Shinobu and I were going to skip town." She told me I—Shinobu—had realized there was no stopping the Fallen. That her village, Coyote, was doomed.<br/><br/>"She wanted to leave this place," Nadiya said. "She didn't want to die here."<br/><br/>So much for that.<br/><br/>—Excerpt from the diary of Himura Shinobu</p>
