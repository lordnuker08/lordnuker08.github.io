<h2>Age-Old Bond</h2>
<p>
The driving bass line of a classic song from Old Earth drove their prey before them. No less than a half-dozen wyverns snarled and clawed at the trio as they stabbed and blasted their way through the wilds of Mars.<br/><br/>Praedyth wished hard. Wished it would never end.<br/><br/>Alongside him, Kabr was a towering giant. An Awoken-made weapon roared in his hands and in his head.<br/><br/>Pahanin was a force, a living embodiment of the Void. Where he pointed, Ahamkhara died.<br/><br/>In the middle, between them, Praedyth smiled. A winged and scaled lion with a boar's tusks leapt at him, and he could swear he saw the thing wink at him as he tore it apart.<br/><br/>Beneath the song, Praedyth heard static, like a comm signal. Best not to think about it.<br/><br/>Praedyth wished again, and the hunt went on.</p>
