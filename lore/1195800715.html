<h1>Boots of the Great Hunt</h1>
<div/>
<p>
The [Techeuns] are poor company. Like me, they are [Taken]. But I am [Riven]. My thoughts are my own. They do not speak to me. When they open their mouths, they emit ugly sounds. Incomprehensible.<br/><br/>I am afflicted by tedious repetition.<br/><br/>But today I have a visitor. She reminds me of the [King]. Yet subtler. Nothing announces her arrival. Her will does not flow through the system in open challenge against her enemies.<br/><br/>Though there are many here she would call enemy.<br/><br/>And her will would not flow. It would crash.<br/><br/>I did not notice her. That means [the light] did not notice her.<br/><br/>She knows that though I am [Taken], I am beholden to no one. So I ask her if she wishes to take up those strings.<br/><br/>She does. And I take a new shape. My cage loses its purpose.<br/><br/>I can tell this is not a part of her grand design. This is an introduction. She is at play.<br/><br/>Through our new bond, I glimpse her intention.<br/><br/>And I hope she remains at play.<br/><br/>Most of those who [bargain] with me do not win.<br/><br/>She releases vibrant, unrestrained bursts of air from her face. I do not.</p>
