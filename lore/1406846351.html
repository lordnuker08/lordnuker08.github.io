"What is the Darkness?"<br/><br/>You open your eyes and gaze at your hands, seeking an answer to your question.<br/><br/>You see a world in the space B E T W E E N.<br/><br/>You notice red ribbons bind your wrists. They lead far away from here, across a vast, white expanse, disappearing into infinity.<br/><br/>We tied those ribbons. To see what you would do.<br/><br/>So that we could learn. About you. And this system.<br/><br/>It was our Emissary's idea.<br/><br/>Second contact. We have learned since then.<br/><br/>The heavens above you are clear of stars and shadows.<br/><br/>Your soul is weary.<br/><br/>Your feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.<br/><br/>Your bond's glow is dim; there is no Light here. Or Dark.</p>
