<h2>16: Politics</h2>
<p>
"Osiris, I'm sorry. Ikora cannot assume your role."<br/><br/>"Ikora, leave please."<br/><br/>She turns to him with a keen tone, "Is it rude for the subject of the conversation to be present?"<br/><br/>"She may stay if she wishes. She deserves to hear why." The Speaker nods to Ikora.<br/><br/>She responds, "I agree."<br/><br/>"Fine."<br/><br/>"Good, now. Osiris—<br/><br/>"Let her stand before the Consensus." Osiris composes himself. "She is more than capable of assuming my duties, and…" hushed now, "she's in good hands here."<br/><br/>The Speaker leans forward. "Osiris. You cannot be allowed to elect your replacement; it took many conversations for us to reach where we are. The Consensus has expectations of the Vanguard. There are duties to be met."<br/><br/>"Speaker; I understand." Ikor—<br/><br/>"Politics."<br/><br/>The Speaker straightens his posture. "Agreements that keep the peace, so that we may fight for a future, together."<br/><br/>"Ikora would be my best representative. She is not a replacement."<br/><br/>"You must be present to perform your duties."<br/><br/>Osiris's eyes bore into the Speaker's mask. "What is my duty if not to protect this City? We are a point in the darkness. We cannot wait for the threats to arrive. Someone has to meet them."<br/><br/>The Speaker stands.  "We will. In time, together."<br/><br/>Osiris sighs, "Be patient…" A lick of malice bled from the word.</p>
