<h2>Solstice Mask (Resplendent)</h2>
<p>
Dax Etono moved through the darkness of the Red Legion storehouse as quietly as he could until he reached the control panels at the far end. He looked around, hoping the towers of equipment and storage containers would keep him hidden.<br/><br/>Lit the panel up.<br/><br/>This panel would generally be used by its owners just for inventory on this one unit. After the Cabal had seized the buildings here, however, the Guardians realized the Legion had unlocked the network to such a degree that if you could access any panel, you could get in almost anywhere in their systems. Dax pulled the buckle from his beltâ€”a mag-hack. He let it click against the panel, and it started to copy over information. Tons of it.<br/><br/>The lights came on. Dax cursed, turning around. Footsteps echoed from both entrances. No enemies were visible yet. He drew his weapon and retrieved the mag-hack. Flicked a switch on its smooth metal side. At least he'd get the Vanguard some of the data.<br/><br/>Three Cabal rounded the corner, firing. Dax took aim to defend himself as information began blazing across the galaxy.</p>
