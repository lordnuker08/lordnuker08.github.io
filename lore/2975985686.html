<h2>VII: The Severed and the Unmade</h2>
<p>
AKRAZUL'S LAMENT<br/><br/>"I am lesser of being and mind, sister.<br/>"Your unmaking shall see me whole.<br/>"My stolen limb, lost to the Light-born in defense of our Taken King's futile reign, has made me a pariah.<br/>"The dishonor of my failings has cast upon us an unwavering shame that spreads like disease, tainting not only my broken self but you and dearest Malkanth alike. I am plague. I am withering disregard.<br/>"Yet, here… in your selfless gift, I find new purpose.<br/>"In your flesh and bone, I will find myself once again.<br/>"In that discovery, I will forever remember you.<br/>"As you will be my vessel on this physical plane. I will be the vessel for your essence—the very core of your will shall live on in me… eternal."<br/><br/>AZAVATH'S PRIDE<br/><br/>"Your words are a joy, brother.<br/>"The last I shall have.<br/>"But know that such pleasures are insignificant when judged against my hatred… my anger.<br/>"I choose my unmaking only because I know the power of your rage, tamed since your severing, but seething below the surface of your charcoal heart.<br/>"I give freely of myself, as did the lesser of the Pit when they offered themselves as waves to be broken against the jagged shore of Zulmak's blade.<br/>"I do so, because I see clearly the path we etch. Its purpose born of heresy, but pure—like your rage.<br/>"My sole regret is that I will not see your fury manifest. That I will not feel these hands inflict such punishment upon the unworthy—upon existence.<br/>"You will make a grand monarch, brother. Through me…<br/>"In my name, writ across the expanse—Azavath, the Suffer Queen of an Ever-Rising Swarm.<br/>"In my husk, the armored vessel of the one I love, my sweet, vengeful Akrazul… my broken prince no more."</p>
