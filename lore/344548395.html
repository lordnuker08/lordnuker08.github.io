<h2>Reverie Dawn Strides</h2>
<p>
Joy wells in her heart when her searching fingers trace the edges of Eleusinia.<br/><br/>She has passed through the desert. She has reached the far side of the chessboard. She is alive, or soon will be.<br/><br/>She opens the door and her joy dies on the threshold.<br/><br/>Her throne world is desecrated.<br/><br/>Not annihilated, as Oryx's was. The pillars and terraces and courtyards still retain their shape. But the roots have rotted, and the geometry festers.<br/><br/>She should have known she would not be the only one to plan for such eventualities.<br/><br/>Oryx's bootprints pucker like scars in the labyrinth that was once only her own.<br/><br/>She sits a while beneath Sjur's statue, then follows his tracks through the ruins of Eleusinia, back to the Dreaming City.</p>
