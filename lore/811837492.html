<h2>Solstice Vest (Rekindled)</h2>
<p>
"Vanguard emergency override, auth chartreuse seven seven dash six."<br/><br/>[Good morning, Hunter Vanguard. Automated voice help system engaged. How can I help you today?]<br/><br/>"I need to take down a giant space rhino before he sees me."<br/><br/>[I assume you're referring to a Cabal enemy. Can you provide me with any more information?]<br/><br/>"He looks like a fifteen-foot-tall spiky cloud with wings and a cape."<br/><br/>[That doesn't align with reference images I have on file. Is he wearing some kind of special armor?]<br/><br/>"Either that or he's got a real weird body. We're talking weirder than usual."<br/><br/>[How can I help you today?]<br/><br/>"Sorry. Sorry. So we need to kill this Ghaul guy. I need ideas. How did that one fireteam take down Crota again?"<br/><br/>[They infiltrated the Ascendant Realm and confronted him at his Oversoul throne.]<br/><br/>"OK, that's probably not gonna work here. What about Skolas?"<br/><br/>[Please specify: when he met his execution in the Prison of Elders—]<br/><br/>"Nope."<br/><br/>[—or when he brought his House of Wolves across time through Vex time gates—]<br/><br/>"Now we're talking! Vex stuff. Teleporting. How do I do that?"</p>
