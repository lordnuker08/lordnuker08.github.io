<h2>Plate of Nohr</h2>
<p>
On the day I lost the Shadows, Ghaul fought and killed Valus Nohr last, only after her bladed shield took the heads off three hundred of his soldiers.<br/><br/>I will miss her, and regret that she did not live to see the coming end. So few of us will.<br/><br/>â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
