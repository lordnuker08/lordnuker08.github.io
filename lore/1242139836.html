<h2>Plate of Nohr</h2>
<p><pre>On the day I lost the Shadows, Ghaul fought and killed Valus Nohr last, only after her bladed shield took the heads off three hundred of his soldiers.

I will miss her, and regret that she did not live to see the coming end. So few of us will.

—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</pre></p>
