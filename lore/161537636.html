<h2>Machina Dei 4</h2>
<p>
From the writings of Brother Vance:<br/><br/>To be a Guardian! How I longed for it. After a near-death experience in which I lost my eyesight, I even believed that I had become a Guardian, that the great Osiris had granted me my dearest wish.<br/><br/>How young and foolish I was!<br/><br/>But now that I am thirty, and wise, I know better. I wanted to be a Guardian, but what I needed was to feel like I was enough. Like I was equal to the great task of life. That I was heroic.<br/><br/>And THAT, my friends, is the beauty of Osiris's teachings! That if you work, if you strive, if you suffer for the sake of improvement, you CAN become better!<br/><br/>It's a hard life I've chosen, full of sweat and pain and darkness. But I have never been so free!</p>
