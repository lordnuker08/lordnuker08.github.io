<h2>Alone as a God</h2>
<p>
My imperial guard marched into the temple where the senate convened. They formed a protective circle from which I might bestow the gift of my address. <br/><br/>"From this day forward, I shall take up all the empire in my embrace. For I am father of the empire, as I am father to all creation. I will suffer no tired institution nor petty bureaucrat to stand between me and my children. I am the perfect loving god, and all will tremble to know me." <br/><br/>The imperial guard charged their rail guns in perfect unison.</p>
