<h2>Bluff</h2>
<p>
I don't play well with loss. I just don't. It's something I tend to avoid. Actively.<br/><br/>It's weird, but… that's where my Queen comes in. And before you make a Reef joke, or mention that witch and her Witches, or her mopey little brother… Don't.<br/><br/>My Queen is not THAT Queen.<br/><br/>My Queen is love.<br/><br/>My Queen is my heart.<br/><br/>My Queen is… hard to explain.<br/><br/>She is my memory of love. My understanding of it… only exists through her.<br/><br/>But she's not here. She's long gone. So I cling to the feeling I get when imagining her, and when I do… I am oh so content.<br/><br/>But it's a struggle.<br/><br/>We lose so much in this life. Any life. All lives, really…<br/><br/>But this life… This Last-Safe-City, end-of-all-things kinda life…?<br/><br/>Even when we win, it seems like all we do is lose.<br/><br/>Scratch that. I don't believe that. If there's one thing I'm not, it's a defeatist. I mean, I defeat. I definitely defeat. One might even say defeating things is my job. ONE of my jobs. One of MANY. <br/><br/>What's not my job is pessimism. Just not my thing. I'm a high-octane optimist and nothing but hugs. Mostly. Not always. Always gets annoying. But mostly… I'm the life of the party.<br/><br/>Not that you could tell from all this woe-is-me soul baring I've been laying on thick for, what, eleven entries now? Ten? In fact, at this point, if you're still listening, you're a braver soul than I.<br/><br/>But, where was I? Oh, yeah…<br/><br/>Optimism.<br/><br/>I'm full of it. Amongst other things, if certain unnamed individuals are to be believed. But, yeah… Each new day we're here is one heck of a reward… Heck of a win. And we should own that. Enjoy it. Embrace it. But never take it for granted.<br/><br/>Heh. Had a Warlock friend who used to say, "Take it for granite." Like the rock. Like g-r-a-n-i-t-e. Smartest guy I've ever known, but maybe he wasn't, ya know? "For granite." Heh. Almost as dumb as his catchphrases.<br/><br/>Come on, Cayde. Stay on target…<br/><br/>Each new day. Helluva thing. Embrace it. Enjoy it. But never forget…<br/><br/>It's a hard life.<br/><br/>And when friends fall. When brothers fade. When your Queen… When…<br/><br/>When we lose the things that matter… Well, a lotta people can use that—own it. That pain. That loss. They find a way to motivate—to celebrate.<br/><br/>For all my charms, seeing the good in the gone ain't one.<br/><br/>And my Queen helps me through that. Because I believe she was something special. She was good. She had to be. And I… Yeah, I do. So damn much.<br/><br/>When the others I've lost along the way start to weigh me down, I think of her, and she just overwrites everything else.<br/><br/>That's how strong her pull is. That's how big the hole she left is… Massive. It devours.<br/><br/>She swallows all other bad things. Not sure it's healthy, the way I deal with loss. But it's my way. It's what works for me. And it makes me happy. Thinking of her…<br/><br/>Makes. Me. Happy.<br/><br/>And the loss fades away.</p>
