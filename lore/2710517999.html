<h1>Equitis Shade Grips</h1>
</div>
<p>
They say the Cabal are not a subtle people. We have fallen so far.<br/><br/>The Cabal I knew were better. We understood that there is power in subtlety.<br/><br/>And that's what it'll take to recover the throne at the center of my homeworld. The seat meant for me.<br/><br/>Open war is for savages. Pit fighters. The Red Legion. There shall be a day, long before the end comes, when that throne is mine again.<br/><br/>And a Shadow of your Guardian-tribe would be the ideal instrument of assassination that will take it for me.<br/><br/>—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
