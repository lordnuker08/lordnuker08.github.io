<h2>Bond of the Great Hunt</h2>
<p>
I am [Riven]. And I am pleased.<br/><br/>The [Techeun] believe that with my heart in tow I will remain imprisoned.<br/><br/>But my [bargain] with them is fulfilled. And they will pay.<br/><br/>This [City] will pay.<br/><br/>But what about you? Brother-slayer. Spawn-killer. [Child of light]. What will you do now that we are bonded for all your lives?<br/><br/>I gave you everything you wanted in that moment. Everything you needed. You complete your [raid]. And you are rewarded for your efforts.<br/><br/>Did you exhibit a violent display in the aftermath? I wonder. Some of you do. Everyone wants more than they have. A key element of all [bargains].<br/><br/>You are afflicted by tedious repetition. <br/><br/>It is my turn to benefit.<br/><br/>Most of those who [bargain] with me do not win.<br/><br/>O murderer mine.</p>
