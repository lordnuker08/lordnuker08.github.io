<h2>Sealed Ahamkara Grasps</h2>
<p>
Few things can see the Light, but we are not blinded. <br/><br/>The Bearer seeks the truth, but what separates truth from fiction is fragile. <br/><br/>A pair of truths and a single falsehood upon the Bearer we shall impart. <br/><br/>Brother, ally once more, sends his regards. <br/><br/>Dreamer, awakened, the Bearer shall meet. <br/><br/>Light fades, deep within the Prison.</p>
