<h2>Star Map Shell</h2>
<p>
Overheard at the Fu'an Institute Library:<br/><br/>"Get over here and tell me this is what I think this is."<br/><br/>"It looks like Golden Age shipping records."<br/><br/>"Look at these quantities! It must be a colony ship!"<br/><br/>"'Must be'? Excuse me, you do remember you're supposed to be a scholar, right?"<br/><br/>"Come on, we know they were sending out colony ships in the Golden Age."<br/><br/>"We know they sent off the Exodus Black, which was lost for centuries until what's-their-name found it on Nessus. And we know they tried to accelerate the launch of the Exodus Blue during the Collapse, but it crashed in the Cosmodrome."<br/><br/>"Think of how many other colors there are!"<br/><br/>"Listen. You think I wouldn't love to know that Humans made it to other solar systems? But we don't have the evidence."<br/><br/>"I'm gonna find it. A Golden Age map of other stars."<br/><br/>"Don't stop looking. Just, you know, cite your sources."</p>
