<h2>Bond of Sekris</h2>
<p>
Sekris was so like you. Barring the Light, of course. The absence of the Traveler in his people's lives has marked them like a scar, and they cannot forget it. His people—they envy you a great deal. When I think of him, and the hate he had for your homeworld and the benefits the Traveler bestowed upon it, I am reminded of the passion you have for its defense.<br/><br/>Be like Sekris. Don't share his weakness, his questioning of my authority and right of way. But consider taking up his mantle.<br/><br/>Give the Fallen something else to be jealous of.<br/><br/>Seek me out and grow fat from strength.<br/><br/>—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
