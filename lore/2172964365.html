<h2>Loaded Question</h2>
<p>
Banshee stares at the paper, then turns it upside down.<br/><br/>"I never said I was an artist," Cayde says over Banshee's shoulder. "This gets at the spirit of it."<br/><br/>Banshee turns the paper around again. "So that's…"<br/><br/>"The laser tracker, yeah."<br/><br/>"Huh." Banshee tilts his head. "And those…"<br/><br/>"Racing stripes."<br/><br/>"…On a fusion rifle."<br/><br/>"We're just—" Cayde throws his arms up. "We're just tossin' out ideas here, pal! Don't shut anything down until you get the whole picture."<br/><br/>"Seems like the picture's the problem."<br/><br/>"OK. Listen—the details aren't important. I just want a good gun that you take out and the fight's already over." He shoots at invisible opponents. "Tsuu-tsuu-tsuu! The end."<br/><br/>Banshee relaxes. He knows good guns.<br/><br/>Cayde clasps Banshee's shoulder. "So is that a yes?"<br/><br/>"Uh-huh."<br/><br/>"Great!" Cayde claps his hands. "Not to rush your genius, but chop-chop, all right? I maybe made a bet with a certain Crucible handler, and I maybe don't have the Glimmer to back it up, so… By the way, you'll do this on an IOU, right?"<br/><br/> Banshee points to the paper one more time. "Is that…?"<br/><br/>"A bottle opener, yes."</p>
