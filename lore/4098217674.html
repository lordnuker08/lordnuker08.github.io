<h2>Solstice Vest (Resplendent)</h2>
<p>
He was floating just about one meter off a comms satellite. I know, 'cause I was talking to him. Not in personâ€”I was manning about 30 weather drones, so I had this array of camera views and readouts. I see him drifting there, drill in hand, by an open panel.<br/><br/>This was a Guardian, with a capital G. I mean, it makes me laugh now. I was thinking, I've seen that guy win ten in a row in the Crucible. Why is he fixing a satellite?<br/><br/>He told me, all casual, that the comms had been acting up, and he was saving the regular maintenance crew a trip into orbit in the middle of a storm. I even asked myself at the time, wow, do Guardians do that?<br/><br/>Anyway, I came to find out, the second the sensors beyond the Wall started going dark, he'd suspected sabotage. Came straight to investigate. He didn't want to freak me out.<br/><br/>He was one of the first that we lost during the invasion. The screen just filled with orange and white. Gone.</p>
