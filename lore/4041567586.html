<h2>Message from Aunor VII</h2>
<p><pre>CORMORANT-LEVEL ENCRYPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS. AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.

I got the feed from your Ghost.

Head to Titan if you're not halfway there already. Drifter and the Spider have worked together on occasion. But it can't benefit Spider to let the Drifter expand his influence in the system. So why help him? I wonder if the Shadows of Yor are involvedâ€”maybe pressure on the Reef at Drifter's benefit?

Local Hunter dens are reporting renegade incidents across the Shore. I haven't been out there since Cayde died. Gambit's been generating a lot of paperwork for me.

I'll check it out.</pre></p>
