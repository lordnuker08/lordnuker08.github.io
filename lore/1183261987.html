For weeks, Felwinter and Felspring searched out Seraph bunkers, trying to find remnants of the technology that built a Golden Age utopia. One night, they camped in a Seraph bunker and spent hours poring over transcripts of old code.<br/><br/>"This is weird," Felspring said, and projected a display of a long string of code. "Look. In the Golden Age, Rasputin executes a protocol called SIDDHARTHA GOLEM. No idea what it is. Some kind of knowledge-gathering. It gathers a bunch of transcripts—conversations with Humans, recordings of music, a huge database of literature…" She whirred and the projection flipped through thousands of words of code, then stopped again. "Here. Early Dark Age. A submind in Old Russia says SIDDHARTHA GOLEM is active. And gone rogue." Her voice dropped. "Around the time I found you."<br/><br/>Felwinter studied the code. It was almost like sight-reading—not quite effortless, but like a native tongue he'd forgotten.<br/><br/>"But what is SIDDHARTHA GOLEM?" he murmured.<br/><br/>Felspring zipped back and forth through the code again at a nervous, stuttering pace, then stopped it. Then scrolled through the code again, stopped. Scrolled again, stopped. "Wait." Her voice quivered just a little. "See that? This is the first time SIDDHARTHA GOLEM is mentioned. It…" She paused, then went on, quieter, "It says, 'Initiate SIDDHARTHA GOLEM upload at DSC-342.'" A beat. "DSC, Felwinter."<br/><br/>Felwinter was silent, thinking, uncomprehending. "DSC?" he asked quietly.<br/><br/>"Deep Stone Crypt." She was almost whispering now. "SIDDHARTHA GOLEM was an Exo."<br/><br/>Felwinter looked down at himself, at his hands. He turned them over, studying the worn metal of his palms.<br/><br/>The silence filled the bunker nearly to bursting.<br/><br/>To Felwinter, it felt like years until either of them spoke again. The whole time, Felspring watched him, frozen in the air.<br/><br/>"He's you," she whispered.</p>
