<h2>Shadow's Strides</h2>
<p>
You are one of them, so you must know:<br/><br/>Whatever happened to that one of the Hunter-tribe who sought retribution on the Hive?<br/><br/>Does she not frequent your Hunter dens?<br/><br/>My scribes learned she was instrumental in the defeat of the Taken King, and before that, his son. By your hand.<br/><br/>Send her my way if you see her. Please.<br/><br/>I would so like to meet her.<br/><br/>â€”Emperor Calus</p>
