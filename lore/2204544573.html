Ghaul spent too much time in too close communion with those I had humbled. No good would come of those hushed tones and sidelong glances. Did he think I would not notice? <br/><br/>I dispatched a spy to follow him. To think that I felt guilt in that moment; one should never doubt their gut when it comes to trust in another.  <br/><br/>I realize now what I should have realized then. As I am like no other, then no other is alone as I. What a curse it is to be a god that loves!</p>
