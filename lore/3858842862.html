No. Your systems are isolated, Firewall."<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//PURPOSE?<br/><br/>"Clovis Bray already has enough visibility into the K1 project. I won't have them claiming every discovery we make as their own. Firewall, why are you asking about connecting to Rasputin?"<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//CLASSIFIED.<br/><br/>"Classified? By whom?"<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//SECURITY PROTOCOL.<br/><br/>"A security protocol built into you by Clovis Bray? Or did Rasputin upload some black-box command into you before you were disconnected?"<br/><br/>EMERGENCY//COMMANDEER STATION CONTROLS\STATION CONTROLS COMMANDEERED<br/>RECUSE EMERGENCY COMMAND\RECUSED<br/>RECUSE RECUSE COMMAND\RECUSED\RECUSED\RECUSED\RECUSED\RECUSED<br/>AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.<br/><br/>"Is that so? Firewall, bring up a record of your self-commands."<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//HOLOGRAM\PROFFERED<br/><br/>"I knew allowing one of Clovis Bray's AIs on this mission was a mistake—even one as primitive as you. What are all these recusal commands and file movements?"<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.<br/><br/>"I see. I also see a number of corrupted files. Firewall, have you been manipulated by Clovis Bray since your installation?"<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//NEGATIVE.<br/><br/>"Why is so much data being taken up by hidden files?"<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.<br/><br/>"I see. I suppose you want me to have a Clovis Bray technician come and check you out. Maybe even have Rasputin do some diagnostics."<br/><br/>AI-COM/FRWL//AFFIRMATIVE.<br/><br/>"Negative."</p>
