<p><pre>RECORD: 1712M095$LUN-2.140 [RECUSAL MIRROR RECORD]
IDENTITIES: Commander Kuang Xuan
LOCATION: K1 Dig Site 2, Communion, Archives
THREAT DETECT: Level 4, 6, 7, 9—Psychosis [Dangerous], Psychosis, Unauthorized Cognizance, Crew Impairment
THREAT RESPONSE: Emergency Response, Exhibit Record 967, FILE//REPORT TO RASPUTIN


AI-COM/FRWL//COMMANDER, CONNECT TO RASPUTIN?

"What? No. Your systems are isolated, Firewall."

AI-COM/FRWL//PURPOSE?

"Clovis Bray already has enough visibility into the K1 project. I won't have them claiming every discovery we make as their own. Firewall, why are you asking about connecting to Rasputin?"

AI-COM/FRWL//CLASSIFIED.

"Classified? By whom?"

AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//SECURITY PROTOCOL.

"A security protocol built into you by Clovis Bray? Or did Rasputin upload some black-box command into you before you were disconnected?"

AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.

"Is that so? Firewall, bring up a record of your self-commands."

AI-COM/FRWL//HOLOGRAM\PROFFERED

"I knew allowing one of Clovis Bray's AIs on this mission was a mistake—even one as primitive as you. What are all these recusal commands and file movements?"

AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.

"I see. I also see a number of corrupted files. Firewall, have you been manipulated by Clovis Bray since your installation?"

AI-COM/FRWL//NEGATIVE.

"Why is so much data being taken up by hidden files?"

AI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.

"I see. I suppose you want me to have a Clovis Bray technician come and check you out. Maybe even have Rasputin do some diagnostics."

AI-COM/FRWL//AFFIRMATIVE.

"Negative."</pre></p>
