Vale: It is time.<br/><br/>Callum: I am ready.<br/><br/>Vale: You cannot return from this.<br/><br/>Callum: Yeah. That was the deal.<br/><br/>Vale: And you go forth with no regrets?<br/><br/>Callum: We have riled the foolish and set the trap. If my end is the means by which we can ensure a generation of those whom the shadows would corrupt are removed from the playing field, then my end is welcome.<br/><br/>Vale: Braver words have never been spoken.<br/><br/>Callum: And Paola?<br/><br/>Vale: Your Ghost understands as well as you. She is safe now, with Bane, given a new shell and… sad… but aware of what is at stake.<br/><br/>Callum: Whose Ghost was this?<br/><br/>Vale: Unknown. A dead thing wrapped in your familiar's carcass. Simply play your part, stab the thing, and when you are gone, I will plant the audio to set you as the martyr and myself as the villain.<br/><br/>Callum: And what if they discover Malphur and Orsa are one and the same?<br/><br/>Vale: They will not.<br/><br/>Callum: Then onward, right?<br/><br/>Vale: Ever.<br/><br/>Callum: It's been an honor.<br/><br/>Vale: The honor is now, has ever been, and will always be… mine.<br/><br/>Callum: Too kind. Go well, friend.<br/><br/>Vale: I will, brother. RTL.</p>
