<h2>Opulent Stalker Vest</h2>
<p>
MCXIII, forthcoming.<br/>Recorded by Underscribe Shipal<br/><br/>Thus did the Shadow of Earth slay the Warlock Osiris.<br/><br/>There was a Guardian named Osiris who defied the Shadow of Earth, saying: "If you are really the mightiest that Earth has to offer, then I challenge you in a battle of wits."<br/><br/>Then Osiris disappeared into the Infinite Forest, scattering his Reflections about him so as to mask himself.<br/><br/>But the Shadow of Earth went to the First Vex, and said to it: "My love for you is as rational as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter."<br/><br/>The Vex, faced with an impossible problem, promptly perished, and with it, all Vex and all their workings crumbled into empty chassis and chalky cubes.<br/><br/>Thus Osiris, deprived of his Reflections, was exposed, and the Shadow of Earth slew him easily.</p>
