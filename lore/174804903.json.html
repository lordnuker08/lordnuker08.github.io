<h2>The Long Walk</h2>
<p><pre>[Eight sparks. A ninth, dim in the corner. And Orin in the middle.] 
ORIN: Are we all here? Come into the light, please. 
G-9: I like where I am. 
ORIN: They said you all went to the deep without a ship. How? 
G-7: Our charges are gone, but we're still creatures of Light. No different from the one you carry in your pocket. 
ORIN: You're all either very brave or very foolish. 
G-6: You sound like Shaxx. 
G-5: She does. I'm glad my charge is gone. 
G-4: Don't say that. 
G-5: It's true. 
G-4: Don't say it out loud. Some of us go our whole lives without finding one. Show some respect. 
G-5: Don't talk like you're better than me. You're in here, too. 
ORIN: Please. I'm sorry to call you all here, butâ€” 
G-2: You're not sorry. 
ORIN: I need to know what you found out there. 
G-9: Nothing. 
ORIN: At least give me the coordinates.</pre></p>
