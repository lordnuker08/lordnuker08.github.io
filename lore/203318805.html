"I want a name."<br/><br/>"Is this because of Sagira? She is a terrible influence on you."<br/><br/>"She has a name. People don't just call her 'Ghost.' It's insulting being called 'Ghost.' I'm not a thing. I'm me."<br/><br/>"Who are you, then?"<br/><br/>"I'm… I don't know. I'm me."<br/><br/>"And you want me to define you? That sounds like you're a thing."<br/><br/>"You're insufferable, do you know that?"<br/><br/>"You didn't have to bring me back."<br/><br/>"You know that's not true."<br/><br/>"Is it?"<br/><br/>"There you go again, Tyra, questioning everything. Treating the entire world like a puzzle that you have to record, and analyze, and put in your files."<br/><br/>"I cannot do anything else. If I do not question, do not study, do not learn, I have no purpose. 'Every mind has its own form.'"<br/><br/>"You've been reading philosophy again."<br/><br/>"Rousseau. Ikora lent me a copy."<br/><br/>"Hmmph."<br/><br/>"Don't pout, Ghost. It's annoying."<br/><br/>"So is being called Ghost. Might as well cover me with a sheet."<br/><br/>"Choose your own name. You don't need me to define you."<br/><br/>"I will!"<br/><br/>… … …<br/><br/>"Well? What is your name, Ghost?"<br/><br/>"Don't call me Ghost."</p>
