<h2>The Prospector</h2>
<p><pre>“Get your axe and your pick and your shovel and your spine. We're goin' prospectin'.” 
“What?” 
“That. The quote. I don't get it.” 
“It's an old saying. It's about puttin' in a hard day's work.” 
“Seems… antiquated.” 
“How so?”
“My grenade launcher's full auto and goes boom on command. What do I need hand tools for?” 
“It's a metaphor. It ain't literal. At least not anymore. Your launcher is your hand tool.” 
“Ahh. Got it. Good to know.”</pre></p>
