<h2>The Prospector</h2>
<p>
“Get your axe and your pick and your shovel and your spine. We're goin' prospectin'.” <br/>“What?” <br/>“That. The quote. I don't get it.” <br/>“It's an old saying. It's about puttin' in a hard day's work.” <br/>“Seems… antiquated.” <br/>“How so?”<br/>“My grenade launcher's full auto and goes boom on command. What do I need hand tools for?” <br/>“It's a metaphor. It ain't literal. At least not anymore. Your launcher is your hand tool.” <br/>“Ahh. Got it. Good to know.”</p>
