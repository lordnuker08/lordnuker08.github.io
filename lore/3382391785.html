<h2>Sentinel</h2>
<p>
I'm shaking, hands on my knees, panting. Let the monsters come. Let them come forever. Let them climb the piled bodies of their dead. I don't care. That's the thing I do better than anyone. Not care. Let them come in their hundreds and every one will die at my feet. I don't care about their homing rockets, their exotic matter slugs, their blades from another dimension. <br/><br/>I don't care because I cannot be moved. I am the wall against which the Darkness breaks. <br/><br/>Malphur can turn his gun to fire and Shinobu can dance with lightning, but when the horrors run out of the dark, I am the one who does not move.  <br/><br/>I am a wall. And walls don't move. Because walls don't care.</p>
