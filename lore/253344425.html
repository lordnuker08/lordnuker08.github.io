<h2>Mask of Feltroc</h2>
<p>
Feltroc, the Skull-Piercer, wore this last. A gun in her hands was a guarantee of victory. Whispers that my Shadows could kill from anywhere, as quickly as a spoken word, drew from her deeds.<br/><br/>There is a tribe among Guardians with similar penchants for surgical strikes, is there not? Perhaps one of them could take her place.<br/><br/>â€”Calus, Emperor of the Cabal</p>
