<h2>Sunbracers</h2>
<p>
“Thanks. Helium reactors still intact. What did you call them?” <br/>“Sunbreakers.” <br/>“Hmm. Bad idea. I go around touting that name and those mercs will come out of their caves and I'll have twice the trouble. I've got enough bad blood with those barbarians.” <br/>“What?” <br/>“The Sunbreakers, old Titan order, super serious mercenaries, fire hammers? Been in the wilds for decades, and word is they've made a new pact with the City, so there's bound to be more of them.” <br/>“It's just a name.” <br/>“You tell them that, they'll probably put a bounty on you and try to sacrifice you to their forge. I'll call them Sunbracers.” <br/>“Call them what you want. To me they'll always be Sunbreakers.”</p>
