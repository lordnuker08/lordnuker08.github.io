1: Manse-5, what's your status?
2: Three Pikes on my tail coming into the Gulch. No biggie.

1: Come in, Manse!

1: We're near the Firebase, but we can head back.
2: Woohoo— [explosion]
1: Manse!
2: Did a little barrel roll there! Got two Pikes… Uh-oh. Cabal.
1: It's no big deal to come back for you.
2: Big ship. Big. Heading right for it.
1: Uh, go around it.
2: [sustained thrumming]
1: Manse.
2: [thrumming] [explosion]
