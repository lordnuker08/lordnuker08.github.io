<h2>Vesper of Radius</h2>
<p>
Ikora Rey's personal library has no door. That's not a problem for the Hidden.<br/><br/>One moment, Ikora is alone at her desk, head bowed over a dusty tome. The next, Chalco Yong stands behind her.<br/><br/>"I wondered what you were up to," says Chalco.<br/><br/>"Really?" Ikora doesn't turn. "I always know what you're up to."<br/><br/>"I surprised you. Admit it."<br/><br/>"I promised I'd never lie to you, Chalco."<br/><br/>The Hunter heaves a sigh and drapes an arm over Ikora's shoulder to read from her tome.<br/><br/>"This is why you're taking less field work? Because you're reading 'On Circles, Volume 12'?"<br/><br/>"I wrote it."<br/><br/>"Unsurprising."<br/><br/>"I have to rewrite it. All twelve volumes."<br/><br/>"Dare I ask why?"<br/><br/>"The Traveler is alive!"<br/><br/>"I've heard," Chalco shrugs. "So?"<br/><br/>"So, our physics framework was completely wrong!"<br/><br/>"Even about, like, circles?"<br/><br/>Ikora turns to look Chalco in the eye. "Especially about circles."</p>
