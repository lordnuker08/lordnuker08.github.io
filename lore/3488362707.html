<h2>Phoenix Protocol</h2>
<p>
"Warlocks are edging in on Titan territory, I tell you."<br/><br/>"What do you mean?"<br/><br/>"Well, first I started losing fistfights with them in the Crucible. That's an affront to everything Titans stand for. If Wei-Ning were here, she'd die of shame!"<br/><br/>"I'm sure she'd be thrilled, honestly."<br/><br/>"That's beside the point. This thing with the fancy rift? It's basically Ward of Dawn."<br/><br/>"It doesn't block ballistics."<br/><br/>"But it does everything else! It's the same thing as the Ward we had before the Red Legion! It's outright plagiaristic!"<br/><br/>"It doesn't blind people either."<br/><br/>"Won't you just let me have my outrage?"</p>
