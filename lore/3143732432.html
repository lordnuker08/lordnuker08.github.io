The Spider eyes the Drifter, boots to bandana.<br/><br/>"Mm. My favorite…" Spider trails off with a drag of ether to select a title befitting the Drifter, "…nothing."<br/><br/>"You think this'll take?" The Drifter says and nods skyward, kicking an empty ether canister off the side of their floating mote of Reef. Red streaks burn in the star-sea sky beyond the vast cloud of asteroids and dust, drawing the shape of a new constellation as the Warmind launches fresh guns.<br/><br/>"An 'almighty' effort. Splendid." Spider steps off a transit craft, alone. "We could have met in… a more protected place."<br/><br/>"You don't like being seen with me?"<br/><br/>"The Spider is a friend to all, but not all my friends are friends," Spider says and focuses his gaze on the Drifter. "You should have come to me."<br/><br/>"You keep too many bodies around. Bodies can stab you in the back."<br/><br/>"Running shows your back," the Spider's voice shudders, "to everyone."<br/><br/>Drifter pauses a moment and looks around at the desolate scape. Small boulders hang in space. They slowly drift towards each other, make contact, and bounce away on random trajectories. Some stick; incorporated via destructive consummation. He scowls and turns back to Spider. "Stretch your legs. No one here for miles."<br/><br/>The Spider unfurls himself, slurping a heavy vacuumous drag from his rebreather. Fully upright, he dwarfs the Drifter in shadow. "Isolation… is not the same as protection, friend."<br/><br/>"Friendship gonna save us from what's coming?" Drifter asks. He places his fingertips together, the space between his hands resembling a triangle.<br/><br/>"The odds aren't in your favor, but…" a guttural laugh ripples from Spider's belly and sends vibration through the loose-packed dirt underfoot, "I'm the wrong one to come to for comfort."<br/><br/>"I get it. You tried running last time. Didn't work. Now you're trying to hide. Let me give you some advice: that don't work either."<br/><br/>"Hiding? the Spider asks and waits. "The board changes. The board clears. I don't play, I just price the pieces."<br/><br/>"Cold-blooded. World's ending and you want a run at it for all it's got."<br/><br/>"'End' is a matter of perspective. Devastation is oftentimes," he says with a breath, "profitable."<br/><br/>"What if nothing's left? Skin and bones?"<br/><br/>"There's always ivory among the bones."<br/><br/>"Bull."<br/><br/>Spider slings a single breathy, "Ha."<br/><br/>"You remind me of my compatriots." Spider wraps his fingers around a small clod of earth drifting by. "They looked at the Whirlwind, just like you. Scared." He closes his hand, crushing the clod into a dense mound. It fractures into several pieces that waft away as Spider releases his grip. "But here we are, living on anyway."<br/><br/>"Yeah. Fallen."<br/><br/>"Fallen. I hold favor among Witches, and Kells, and whispering agents… of every shade and shape. My web is vast, and I have proven useful. Let the kings bloody each other. I'll direct the runoff."<br/><br/>"You talking about Guardians? Hate to break it to you, but they're a cheap date."<br/><br/>"Cheap is malleable. Cheap becomes… cheaper in desperation."<br/><br/>"Yeah." The Drifter pulls a small and ornate box of Awoken design from his rucksack. "Who you lookin' for with this anyway?"<br/><br/>The Spider steps toward Drifter, smothering his personal space. "Options, my dear rogue; tangled in the web." He takes the box with his dominant arms and plops two stuffed sacks of Ghost shells into the Drifter's hands with his others.<br/><br/>"Went through hell to get that little box. Don't come with no throne," Drifter says, holding his voice steady, jaw tense to stay the trembling.<br/><br/>The Spider chitters as a shiver runs through him. "No. Just a looking-glass window. Good business, friend." The hulking Fallen Don turns to leave. "Remember… remain useful."<br/><br/>"When you find 'em, you sure the past won't come knocking?"<br/><br/>"No one minds the Spider."<br/><br/>"Lucky."</p>
