<h2>Gauntlets of Rull</h2>
<p>
The greatest warriors of the Clipse lay dead. They formed a bloody trail through the Leviathan. Only Rull had lived to see the throne room. <br/><br/>Calus calmly sipped his wine and considered Rull from the height of his golden seat. <br/><br/>"Are you hungry?" <br/><br/>Rull stared dumbfounded, bleeding and exhausted. He didn't know what to make of a creature that would casually offer sustenance and slaughter in equal measure. <br/><br/>"I offer you a warrior's paradise, Rull of the Clipse. Join me, and be counted among the lucky few that might see the end of this world." <br/><br/>What could Rull do but accept?</p>
