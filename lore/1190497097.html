Winter had struck hard. The citizens of the 32nd Sector of Old Russia were ill prepared, many recently homeless due to the unrelenting snow storm that plagued the land. In search of shelter and barely clinging to life, they turned to the man who promised protection: The Titan Warlord, Citan.<br/><br/>Reluctant to offer rations—despite a stable full of potential meals, an overstocked keep, and a magnificent Great Hall garnished with every delicacy one could desire—Citan held a firm grasp over the supply chain.

His Light was already all the advantage needed to ensure the status quo.<br/><br/>But hunger could cause people to act irrationally, an oversight in Citan's philosophy, and soon they were banging down the doors of his stronghold.
