<h1>Shadow's Mind</h1>
<div/>
<p>
I require a Shadow of your Guardian-tribe to decipher the languages of the Hive.<br/><br/>They say there is one among your tribe named "broken" and outcast who is the foremost expert.<br/><br/>I tried to tempt him with an old trinket he left behind, but he failed to appear. Perhaps you've noticed it is free for the taking.<br/><br/>I would ask the Hunter—she is nearly his equal—but when her kind does not want to be found, even the Emperor must wait.<br/><br/>So receive this armored mantle as a gift—and as a request for favor:<br/><br/>One day, I shall call on you.<br/><br/>—Emperor Calus</p>
