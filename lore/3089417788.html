<h2>MIDA Mini-Tool</h2>
<p>
2472/11/17 — 4.9°S 0°E <br/>AUDIO ONLY <br/>Strauss is gone. Whole sky alight as his ship set off. I might be the last MIDA survivor on Mars. The gun detected teleports yesterday and I had to move camp. Cannot shake the fear that they will send battleroids; even this AI marvel couldn't save me. <br/><br/>Shot the ice this morning. The gun fired a thermal round and then a pellet of water purifier. Came out pure and sweet. Marvelous. I've been reading the gun's Encyclopedia Arcana. All about the crash that became Strauss's obsession and hope. “Metastability in the salvaged construct!” Ha ha! Let's hope our ideals too can pass through grief, fury, and envy into a new freedom elsewhere. <br/><br/>Wonder if the gun heard me when I asked to go somewhere better. Wonder why it led me here. Going to follow its compass tonight. Down below.</p>
