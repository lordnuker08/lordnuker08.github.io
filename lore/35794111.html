"You ferried a Lightbearer to the outer system," Aunor says and cocks the hammer on her weapon. "They did not return with you."<br/><br/>"I learned the secret. The one your hounds have hidden away in that quaint little vault." Sola smiles red through split lips. "You're on the losing side."<br/><br/>"Do you think you have nothing to lose, or that I wouldn't take it from you? You're sorely, and soon to be regretfully, mistaken."<br/><br/>Sola spits in Aunor's face. "You have limits. You have masters." A twisted Light shimmers in Sola's hand as she moves to attack. "Enjoy hanging to death in your strings!"<br/><br/>Aunor pulls the trigger unflinchingly. Sola drops. "Disgrace of a Warlock."<br/><br/>Sola's Ghost hangs motionless in the air beside her dead charge. A breeze rustles char from the patches of blackened grass around them. Her iris flicks next to the two Praxic watchdogs: the Warlock who pulled the trigger and the Titan partner who shakes a recent death from his bones.<br/><br/>Aunor turns to her colleague. "Should we have her resurrected and ask again?"<br/><br/>The Titan wipes blood from his chest plate as his Ghost patches his armor. A fresh bullet hole sits above his heart. "No, I think she made herself clear the first time."<br/><br/>Sola's Ghost pipes up, "Who says I would?"<br/><br/>"You have nothing to fear, Little Light. Your Guardian is… touched. We are here to help."<br/><br/>"You mean you're here to put us down."<br/><br/>"Not presently. Give us the coordinates of your heading. Then, you will be escorted to the City in peace."<br/><br/>"You know. If you didn't, you wouldn't be here."<br/><br/>"We've tracked the gravitational disturbances, yes. The Warmind had revealed the anomaly was moving through the outer system. But you know that, and you know how to find it."<br/><br/>The Ghost mimics a "spit" noise. "Run back to your quiet Traveler. I won't be ordered around anymore!"<br/><br/>Aunor's body deflates as she holsters her weapon. "Bahaghari…" she says. A Ghost appears at Aunor's side. "Prepare our tools. This one appears touched as well."<br/><br/>Bahaghari nods and slips away to follow the order.<br/><br/>The Striker Titan approaches and snaps his  fingers. A stunning bolt of lightning pelts Sola's Ghost out of the air into unconsciousness. "It's affecting Ghosts now too. We should bring them back to the City. This makes five."<br/><br/>He picks up the Ghost and shoulders Sola's body before shuffling off to their ship.<br/><br/>Aunor turns to follow. "Five, and counting," she whispers to herself without taking her eyes off Sola's Ghost.</p>
