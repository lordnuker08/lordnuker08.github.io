I say we\u2026 you\u2026 allow the Drifter to run his game. And let's you and me watch.\n\n\"We watch the action. We watch him. We watch who plays and who doesn't. On top of that, we watch their aggression\u2014who's diving too deep, too fast, who's less keen to grow their knowledge, their strength. And who's simply lookin' to unleash themselves.\n\n\"The true promise of this Gambit is what you and I can learn. About our enemies. Maybe even about ourselves. That has to be first and foremost. After that, we assess Gambit's value and its risks. If the danger escalates, we shut it down. If any Guardians go too far, we shut it down\u2014and them, if need be.\n\n\"My gut says we won't have to. My gut says, against everything I was raised to believe, this is our next step forward.\n\n\"And here's the rub: You know this, but only fair that I reiterate. As secret as this whole mess is, and as vigilant as we'll need to be\u2026 word must spread. It must. And when it does, I need you to corral Zavala and any others who won't understand.\n\n\"'Cuz the other side of that jade coin is the trap being set\u2014this long con\u2014the final bend after a long haul. If Drifter plays his part\u2014and I believe he will\u2014then those who test the edges of the Light will hear tell and come a'callin'. The Shadows brought to Light.\n\n\"But the ruse must be complete. Every Guardian must play their part. If you can buy in\u2014if you can see the value in what's to come\u2014then we roll. If not\u2026\n\n\"You can stop this here and now. I'll put a bullet in him, be done with it.\n\n\"Just say the word.\"\n\n\u2014A Renegade's Observations of a Drifter","name":"The Price of a Double-Sided Coin","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/9300a013bff7274e6c74569d2819953c.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3535691360,"index":562,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false}
