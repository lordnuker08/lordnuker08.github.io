So, we see it play out\u2014his Gambit and ours. It may not be ideal. In fact, I'd say far from. It's just that\u2026\n\n\"I don't see another way forward. The Light is fragile but quick. The Dark, dense and slow. If we want to control the balance, tip it in our favor\u2026 if we want to confront those shadows who would see it shift further toward the night\u2026 we must play in the gray in-between. We must draw them out.\n\n\"Many have fallen to this path. It's not one I tread lightly, but I've found the only way to best a shadow is meet it in the shade.\n\n\"The Vanguard won't allow it\u2014they're noble, but they're flawed. Frightened. Most Guardians wouldn't dare it\u2014too many legends of heroes lost to such unpleasant pursuits.\n\n\"But things have changed\u2026\n\n\"The Oryx slayers and their like have danced within Ascendant Realms. The nightmare legends of bonewalkers and nether worlds have been cast into the Light. Old fears are now trampled beneath enduring triumph. Now, if ever, is the time to step proud into the unknown and bathe it in our Light.\n\n\"And if doing so draws the attention of enemies old and new\u2026 if we tempt damnation\u2026 so be it. We will stand ever vigilant and burn them all away.\n\n\"Or maybe the Drifter pulls a double-cross and our end is met. No way of knowing. No way to tell.\n\n\"I say we let it ride. Trust ourselves. Trust our instincts\u2014our Light.\"\n\n\u2014A Renegade's Observations of a Drifter","name":"Step into the Shade","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/9300a013bff7274e6c74569d2819953c.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3535691364,"index":558,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false}
