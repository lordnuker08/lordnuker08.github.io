Boarding Yor's derelict craft in search of our first answers was the act of children, ignorant to the truths\u2014and the dangers\u2014that marked our journey. It wasn't until later, when more pieces of the whole were uncovered, that we grasped the reality of the odd white noise gnawing the edges of our thoughts. Anymore we call them whispers, but then, in those early days, as we approached and then entered the craft\u2014its kit-bashed roll-cage still identifiable where it wasn't over-crusted in the dark, uneven horror of bone\u2014we mistook their siren call for feedback from a dying ship's failing systems. We were fools.\n\nOrsa found the scribbled glyphs on thick leather inside the craft that once, long ago, belonged to Yor. We couldn't identify the origin of the writing at the time, much less translate. Though we'd all heard the stories of the Hive, an ancient evil and an ancient battle that turned Luna into a forbidden zone\u2014most held them as folklore\u2014scary stories to counteract our natural curiosity and keep brave Guardians from venturing beyond their means. And while we had our theories about Dredgen Yor and how his fall was linked to the nightmare tales of wicked creatures born of bone and shadow, we were cautious not to let assumption guide our inquisition.\n\n\n\u2014hand-scrawled note accompanying Teben Grey's personal translation of ancient Hive text","name":"V: Purpose","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/7df076a912716ef4c429d3fb77fa504d.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":614571557,"index":863,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false}
