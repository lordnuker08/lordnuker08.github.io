In particular, Thorn, the cursed weapon of the Light-killer, Dredgen Yor. But such tools of destruction were only rumor. There was direct evidence of Yor having been a vile bastard, but the legends of his sickly weapon and the disease it spread seemed exaggerated\u2014another ghost story to warn of unknown dangers. But our translations of ancient Hive text seemed to point to truth in the legend. The Hive had rituals for forced evolution. And what we'd found hinted at transmutation through corruption, degradation, and rebirth\u2014the Weapons of Sorrow were real. Worse, they were a road map to a greater threat, a greater evil. \n\nAnd with this realization, our determination to uncover Yor's full truth was bolstered by new, terrifying questions. What if the horrors of Yor's deeds were not the end game? What if his evolution was simply the byproduct of a grander design?\nWhat if he was nothing more than a side effect of an ancient arms race, and the weapons we feared from days long past were nothing more than touchstones on a road map to devastation beyond anything we can imagine? What if \"sorrow\" was just a pit stop on the road to our coming annihilation?\n\n\u2014hand-scrawled note accompanying Teben Grey's personal translation of ancient Hive text","name":"IX: Embrace","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/7df076a912716ef4c429d3fb77fa504d.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":614571561,"index":867,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false}
