This is me smoothing out the rough angles before risking a proposition I know carries baggage.\n\n\"Anyway. He and I went out, found a spot we could be alone, and he showed me. He showed me proof that all of his relics, artifacts, treasures, and junk weren't just for show\u2014our shady friend actually went out and lassoed himself a little piece of hell.\n\n\"While Guardians have been waging war with the Taken, while the City's newest legends have been trespassing on Ascendant ground and kicking in Taken skulls, the Drifter's been playing Warlock\u2014which he ain't, if it wasn't clear. Not by common understanding, anyway. In drawing strength from curiosity and using knowledge to bend understanding to his will, this wily bastard has long since shed any pretensions of class or the limitations therein.\n\n\"While you lot have been having your fun, drunk on loot, dancin' on the corpses of your enemies\u2014he's been watching, learning, stealing, and planning.\n\n\"Now, I make no promises that what he's done was ever intended for the greater good.
