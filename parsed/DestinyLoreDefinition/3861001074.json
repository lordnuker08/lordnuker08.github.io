{"displayProperties":{"description":"Petra called for not one, but two cells. Variks finished his Ether, considering. Perhaps Cayde had finally found Fikrul\u2014and for that, Variks would need every drop of strength he could muster.\n\nHis strides were long and slow as he allowed the Ether to course through him, his posture growing taller and more commanding with each step. At the top of the maxsec wing, his hands flew over the controls. He prepared the two empty cells and ordered extraction Servitors into place, all the while reveling in the thought of the judgment of Fikrul. Finished, he stepped back and waited.\n\nSnarling, yelling, the prisoners entered the wing. One, an Eliksni, Petra shoved hard into one of the two cryo-cells.
