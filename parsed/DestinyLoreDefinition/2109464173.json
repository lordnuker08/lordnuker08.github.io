{"displayProperties":{"description":"Well, Micah-10 and Conar found three more Guardians willing to come to Coyote. None of them look thrilled to be here. I wonder what Micah's paying them. When I asked her if five Guardians would be enough to protect us from the Kings, she launched into a speech about how being a Guardian means protecting people no matter what. \n\nI know what that means: \u201cFive is not enough. Everyone here is going to die.\u201d \n\nI could run. Same fantasy I've been nursing for years: rappel down from the eastern tallwalk, make for the coast. Conar says that tunnel I can see from the tallwalk\u2014it's full of Fallen. Open spaces like the road are safer. With this information I could probably make it ten whole kilometers from the village before I'm killed.  \n\nThat's four more than I could have otherwise. Maybe it's worth a shot. \n\n\u2014Diary of Himura Shinobu","name":"The Bandwagon","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"Because a group of coyotes is a band!\" \u2014Therin Vai\n\"I refuse to call it that.\"\u2014Nadiya","hash":2109464173,"index":130,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false}
