As each banner snapped into place, a Psion fell to hands and knees, head bowed low. \n\nJarus's shoulder disappeared in the emperor's hand. \u201cCome, let us open your gift.\u201d The two walked past the kneeling warriors. \u201cI have named it for you,\u201d Calus crooned. \u201cI call it God's Will.\u201d \n\nJarus's chest fluttered. The ship was beautiful. A drum sounded. A Cabal emerged, delicately carrying armor, holding it as if it would break. Piece by piece it was placed on the floor in front of Jarus. \n\nThe weight on his shoulder lifted. \u201cThis is yours. When you take it, you are mine.\u201d Calus left. His procession followed. Only God's Will and Jarus remained.","name":"Grips of the Ace-Defiant","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\u201cThe Sindu fly like surgeons operate. And the Ace-Defiants are the best among them.
