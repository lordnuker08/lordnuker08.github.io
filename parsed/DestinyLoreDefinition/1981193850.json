{"displayProperties":{"description":"Taniks was a pain.\n\nTurns out that wasn't the real problem\u2014though it was high on the list at the time.\n\nThe real problem? The freak's STILL a pain. He ain't no Guardian, but the dude's been dead and not more times than I can track. \"Died\" twice by my hand alone. Second time I even looked to deliver some insurance, but he was hauled off by his goons before I could add more lead to the collection I'd deposited in his chest\u2026 and neck\u2026 and gut\u2026 and head.\n\nBut that second time don't matter. I mean, it does, sure, but the important bit here is our first go-round\u2026\n\nWhen Andal and I made our bet that wasn't a bet but really a dare\u2026 THE Dare\u2026 we were eager and ready to track Taniks and hit him with some payback. I had the good luck of finding Taniks first. Had the good luck to kill him, too. So I thought.\n\nSo we all thought.\n\nWhat followed was a party. Osiris even showed up. He and the Speaker had sent Saint-14 after Taniks as well, and maybe Sainty's one hell of a Titan\u2014but we're Hunters. No way were we losing the kill.\n\nLooking back, I wish maybe we had.\n\nAndal kept his word\u2014joined the Vanguard. I tried talking him out of it. We'd made the Dare in a compromised state\u2026 Shiro and I'd just been roughed up, Nian was gone, Lush was broken\u2014emotions were high, liquid was flowing. Andal wasn't buying it. Neither was I. Not really.\n\nThe Dare's the Dare. To back out would've been a mark\u2014would've called Andal into question to every Hunter out there. Even to me. I never would've admitted it to him. But he'd know.\n\nThings got a little weird between us once he joined the Vanguard. All my doing. And I missed him. Didn't like seeing one of the best rule-breakers and world-walkers anyone had ever seen bogged down with bureaucrats. But the weirdness passed\u2026 Brothers don't stay mad at brothers, that's just the way it is.\n\nAs we settled into the new norm, the good times started to roll. They kept on rolling, too\u2026\n\nFor a while, anyway.","name":"Winner Take All","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ff9ae161808440f0f7def6a9c5857170.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1981193850,"index":482,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false}
