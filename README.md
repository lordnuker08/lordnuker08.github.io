# D2 Dashboard

Hi Guardians,

Here is a simple dashboard to see your (or other's?) activities on D2. Just follow the link to this site:

https://lordnuker08.github.io/d2/dashboard

You can optionally append a gamer tag for the player you want:

https://lordnuker08.github.io/d2/dashboard#lordnuker08

Once loaded, you will need to hit the 'Search' button and wait for all the spinning graphics to cease.

The summary tab will show you all the guardian summary.
Activities will show you (you guessed it) your actvities
Charts display simple pvp and pve daily grind charts.


## Why did I do this?
This is a work in progress which I did while working on some new platforms for a real world project. I wanted to polish my skills so this was a good enough area.

###Technologies?
- Chart js
- Vue js
- Python

Also, I liked this cool concept of server less sites where most of the work is done within the browser. As you may know that github.io is not a server side engine for hosting.

## Can you contribute?
Yes, just read the license and ensure that you are happy with it. Don't worry it's GNU GPL blah blah so you should be fine. 
Just fork and send a pull request.

## Will I work more on this?
Hmmm.... lets's see. I will, once I get time from other projects.

# Releases
## 1.0
Initial load with some flaws.
